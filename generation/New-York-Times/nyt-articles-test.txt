WHILE the nation's central bankers appear convinced that the economy can continue to grow briskly without kicking up inflation fears, a growing number of money managers are not so sure. Many financial planners say that for prudent investors, now is the time to deal with inflation -- before prices actually spike. A December survey of U.S. fund managers by Merrill Lynch found that 71 percent thought that inflation would increase in the coming 12 months, up from just 36 percent who thought so in August. And more than a third said in December that they believed that monetary policy was too stimulative, versus only 11 percent who said so in July. ''The Fed's motto has gone from WIN, as in 'Whip Inflation Now,' to SIN, as in 'Start Inflation Now,''' said Don Ross, chief investment officer for National City Investment Management, based in Cleveland. That view, of course, runs counter to the position of the Federal Reserve. Last week, Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor, reiterated that the Fed's ''unusually accommodative'' stance on interest rates was justified, despite concerns that the economy was recovering much faster than had been expected. (The consensus forecast is for gross domestic product to grow at an annual rate of 4.4 percent this year.) Mr. Bernanke said that productivity gains and a weak labor market were keeping inflation at bay. ''For now, I believe that the Federal Reserve has the luxury of being patient,'' he told a gathering of the American Economic Association in San Diego. Recent economic data appear to support his argument, at least for the short term. Core consumer prices fell 0.1 percent in November, after climbing just 0.2 percent in October. Given the absence of wage pressures, Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, said, ''It's hard to see inflation being a major issue for 2004.'' Like Mr. Zandi, Mr. Ross said he thinks that inflation won't become a real concern until 2005. But there are signs that inflationary pressure is simmering. The spread between the yield on 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, and 10-year, non-indexed Treasuries has widened to 2.3 percentage points, from 1.7 in June. ''It's a signal that inflation expectations are moving higher,'' said Daniel O. Shackelford, co-manager of the T. Rowe Price Inflation Protected Bond fund. Commodity prices, meanwhile, have continued to boom. And though prices for finished goods are stable, producer prices for crude goods were up more than 18 percent in November versus the same period in 2002, according to the Labor Department. Another factor that could drive prices higher, economists say, is further weakness in the dollar, which could increase the cost of imported goods for American consumers. ''I think we're going to have more inflation than almost everybody expects,'' said John Bollinger, president of Bollinger Capital Management, based in Manhattan Beach, Calif. Given the enormous amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus injected into the economy in the past two years, Mr. Bollinger said he thought that the nation could be headed toward 3 to 4 percent inflation in 2004, with an ''outside chance of seeing it north of 4 percent.'' John Caldwell, chief investment strategist for the McDonald Financial Group, based in Cleveland, said he thought that was a bit high. Still, Mr. Caldwell said strong economic growth and the Fed's willingness to keep short-term rates low could produce inflation of more than 2.5 percent this year. That would be a jump from present levels. The core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, rose only 1.1 percent over the past 12 months. ''People underestimate the impact of even modest inflation in a modest-return environment,'' said Harold Evensky, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla. He argues that while 3 percent inflation may be tolerable in a period of 20 percent gains in equity prices, 3 percent inflation can quickly dent a portfolio earning just 6 or 7 percent annually. Many financial planners are advising investors to start preparing their portfolios for a possible climb in prices. ''Since every talking head on the news and in print says they aren't worried about inflation, you better have it on your radar,'' says Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management in Los Angeles. ''You don't have to change the asset classes you invest in,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''You just have to change the way those assets are invested.'' For instance, she recommends that bond investors shorten the overall duration or maturities of their fixed-income investments. For those who invest in bond funds, that means going from long-term portfolios to intermediate- and short-term funds. As for traditional inflation hedges like gold, financial planners say it is important to weigh their risks, just as investors should weigh the risk of inflation itself. For instance, gold and basic materials stocks already enjoyed substantial run-ups in 2003 as the economy began to rebound. Gold recently shot up to more than $430 an ounce, its highest level in a decade and a half. Shares of basic-materials companies, which stand to benefit from rising prices -- had a 35 percent return, on average, in 2003. These stocks are now trading at 24 times 2004 earnings, making this sector the second most expensive in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, after technology. An alternative is inflation-protected bonds, or TIPS. Created in 1997, these Treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government, as are other Treasury instruments. But unlike a traditional bond, with a fixed principal value, these securities have a principal amount that rises with inflation. So if you invest $1,000 in a 10-year TIP and inflation kicks up 10 percent over the next decade, you will get back $1,100 at maturity, in addition to the interest payments along the way. Because investors must pay federal taxes annually not only on interest payments but also on the periodic inflation-adjustments made to the bond's principal (even though investors don't receive this so-called phantom income until redemption), financial planners recommend investing in TIPS through a tax-advantaged account. I-Bonds, United States savings bonds that also offer inflation protection, are not tax-disadvantaged in this way. That means you do not receive interest from these savings bonds until you redeem them. They can be bought for as little as $50 at a bank or directly from the Treasury. But these savings bonds aren't that compelling today, because I-Bonds bought from now to April are yielding only 2.19 percent, less than the yield for the average two-year certificate of deposit. Money managers caution against ignoring the risks in TIPS, which are a relatively new asset class. ''We should dispel the notion that you can't lose money in this investment,'' said John Hollyer, co-manager of the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund, which invests in a variety of TIPS. Eric Jacobson, an analyst at Morningstar who follows TIPS funds, notes that when interest rates spiked in July, inflation-protected bond funds lost 4.8 percent of their value that month. For 2003 over all, TIPS funds, which invest in government inflation-indexed bonds of varying maturities, produced an average gain of 7.7 percent. And over the past three years, the average TIPS fund delivered annualized returns of 10.4 percent, which explains their popularity in recent years, despite low inflation. Investors need to be aware of interest rate risk with these bonds, Mr. Jacobson said. For instance, if real interest rates --market rates minus the rate of inflation -- spike, the underlying price of TIPS could easily fall again, as it did in July. Sticking with intermediate-term TIPS funds, instead of long-term portfolios, may reduce but not eliminate this risk. TIPS investors may also be hurt if market interest rates rise in anticipation of inflation that never comes. If commodity prices continue to climb and the economy shows signs of accelerating, the bond market could sell off, pushing long-term market interest rates higher, even if the Fed kept short-term rates low. But if the bond market is wrong and inflation stays low, real rates would still climb, threatening the underlying value of TIPS. STILL, C. Casey Colton, manager of the American Century Inflation-Adjusted Bond fund, argues that if market interest rates rise alongside even modest inflation, TIPS funds are likely to do better than traditional Treasury bond funds. That is because ''real rates would rise at a slower rate than nominal rates,'' Mr. Colton said. The average expense ratio of the 18 TIPS funds tracked by Morningstar is 0.51 percent of assets, which is competitive with other bond fund categories. But the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund charges just 0.22 percent. And Barclays Global Investors recently started an exchange-traded fund -- an index fund that trades like a stock on the New York Stock Exchange -- that tracks the TIPS market. That fund, called iShares Lehman TIPS Bond, has an expense ratio of 0.20 percent. Perhaps TIPS investors would face their biggest risk if the economy grew as quickly as some people now expect, and without much inflation. ''In that case,'' said Mr. Shackelford at T. Rowe Price, ''there's an argument to be made that real yields offered by TIPS would start to look too low relative to returns offered by other assets'' -- namely stocks.
YEN REBOUNDS.  Japan's currency jumped 2 percent on views that the central bank was trying to raise its value by buying yen and selling dollars. In New York, the dollar fell to 143.47 yen from an eight-year high of 146.15 Monday.
SEX  HETEROSEXUALITY  By William H. Masters, Virginia E. Johnson and Robert C. Kolodny. HarperCollins, $27.50. There is something -- how to say it? -- refreshing about "Heterosexuality," the new survey of sexual relations by William H. Masters, Virginia E. Johnson and their longtime collaborator, Robert C. Kolodny. From Chapter 1 ("Love and Intimacy") to Chapters 16 and 17 ("Sex and Aging" and "Affairs"), if your relationships are not "problematic," this soothing artifact is for you. The authors apply their trademarked clinical detachment to tips for the physical side, draw liberally from the experts (from Deborah Tannen to Erik Erikson) on the psychosocial side and rely on sewing-circle maxims for the rest: "Be aware that holidays are a time when loneliness can be particularly hard to deal with." That last, incidentally, comes up in advice on how to deal with sick people in Chapter 14, which broaches a dicey new subject, "H.I.V. Infection and AIDS." CAROLINE RAND HERRON
Britain's economy grew four-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, less than economists were expecting, as the "mad cow disease" scare brought a sharp drop in farm production. The Office for National Statistics said today that the lost beef sales from mad cow disease took a tenth of a percentage point off the quarterly gross domestic product growth. European countries banned imports of British beef and byproducts and older herds were destroyed after suspicions were raised about links to a brain disease in humans. London-based economists said mad cow disease may weigh on third-quarter growth, but to a lesser extent. Forecasters had been expecting a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent from the first quarter. A Treasury spokesman said: "Growth is expected to pick up starting in the second half of this year. Recent figures, surveys and independent forecasters support this view."
To the Editor: Summer jobs (Economic Scene, July 19) offer many teenagers a first job experience, and give them money for school and other expenses. One should not underestimate the impact of $900 in earnings for impoverished families, and spending that money locally in community stores. In New York City, nearly 50,000 teenagers have worked each year in summer camps, libraries and senior centers. Without them, many organizations would be forced to cut or cancel summer services, which provide supervised activity for children of working parents. Without jobs, teenagers would lose work force experience and access to mentors and future employers, and the self-esteem that comes from a paycheck. New York and the nation should work to preserve summer youth employment. EMILY MENLO MARKS  Executive Director  United Neighborhood Houses  New York, July 23, 2001
Last Sunday, in discussing the reasons his Yellow Jackets had advanced to the regional semifinals of the N.C.A.A. tournament, Georgia Tech Coach Paul Hewitt added one significant factor. ''And luck,'' he said. ''Don't forget about luck.'' Georgia Tech got a dose of bad luck early in its game against Nevada on Friday night, when B. J. Elder left with a sprained right ankle. Elder, a junior guard, is the team's top scorer with an average of 16.2 points. Without him, the third-seeded Yellow Jackets were perhaps vulnerable to an upset by 10th-seeded Nevada, the lowest-seeded team playing in the Round of 16. And sure enough, the Wolf Pack (25-9) led the Yellow Jackets by 5 points at halftime and stayed close the rest of the way. But Georgia Tech (26-9) went ahead by a point with 7 minutes 32 seconds left in the second half when Marvin Lewis -- who led the Yellow Jackets with 23 points -- sank two free throws after a technical foul against Nevada. And the Yellow Jackets went ahead to stay when Will Bynum, who filled in for Elder, made a reverse layup as he bulled past Todd Okeson and Nick Fazekas along the baseline with 1:04 left. The Wolf Pack did not score after that, and Georgia Tech came away with a 72-67 victory to move into the regional final on Sunday against fourth-seeded Kansas (24-8). ''For us to get this win, it shows a lot more about our toughness than our luck,'' Hewitt said. Lewis said he knew his teammates were counting on him after Elder left the game. ''We've got to do without him,'' Lewis said. ''When B. J. went down, people were still looking to get me shots.'' It was not known Friday night whether Elder would play Sunday against Kansas. ''He has a sprained ankle,'' Hewitt said. ''We'll find out in the morning. The X-ray came back negative. I don't know what's going to happen. Right now, we plan on him playing.'' Luke Schenscher, the 7-foot-1 center from Australia, led Georgia Tech in rebounds with 9. Bynum finished with 9 points in 21 minutes. Kirk Snyder, a 6-6 junior guard, led Nevada with 21 points. Okeson of Nevada had 13 points and 10 rebounds. But his energetic efforts near the end, long shots and drives, were unsuccessful. Many Georgia Tech players discussed the layup by Bynum, a highlight play. Jarrett Jack, the point guard, said: ''That's definitely a Will Bynum-type play. He gave us a great surge off the bench.'' Elder sprained his right ankle less than three minutes into the game. In part because of his absence, the Wolf Pack held a 39-34 halftime lead and hope for a significant upset. Okeson, a 6-foot senior guard, had 11 points and 6 rebounds in the first half. Lewis, a 6-4 senior guard, led the Yellow Jackets with 10 points, and Isma'il Muhammad had 6 rebounds. But Georgia Tech came back to take a 47-45 lead in five minutes into the second half on a reverse layup by Jack. Nevada reached the Round of 16 with victories last weekend over Michigan State and Gonzaga. Georgia Tech advanced to the regional semifinals by beating Northern Iowa and Boston College. The Wolf Pack had played in the N.C.A.A. tournament only twice before, losing in their first game in 1984 and 1985. This is Georgia Tech's first tournament appearance since 2001. It reached the Final Four in 1990. N.C.A.A. | MEN'S ROUND OF 16
To the Editor: This is in response to Betsy Wade's ''Rules of the Road for A.T.M. Fees'' (Practical Traveler, Dec. 17). In 1999, my daughter went to Europe after graduating from college and tried to use her MAC-linked card at Heathrow Airport and several other places in Europe, and it was denied. We would up wiring her money. She was told (and we were surprised to learn) that many places accept A.T.M. cards only if attached to a checking account, and not a savings account, which a lot of young people have. ARLENE DOLCE  Roseland, N.J. Merrill Halpern, vice president of MasterCard International-Cirrus, responds: A.T.M. terminals abroad may not ask consumers to select the type of account they wish to withdraw from. If not, the A.T.M. generally passes a ''no account specified'' request through its network to the bank that issued the card. The card-issuing institution determines whether to accept or deny the transaction. For our part, the Cirrus network requires member banks to apply such generic requests for withdrawls to whichever type of deposit account the consumer has. College students should contact their banks to ask to about this matter before they plan to use their cards abroad.

Revamped in SoHo When the husband and son of the country's first female Vice Presidential candidate open a restaurant, there is something wonderfully fitting about it. Which is why Cascabel, a year-old SoHo restaurant, has been more famous for its proprietors than for its food. But the Zaccaros, John Jr. and Sr., were not happy with the situation, so they invited Tom Valenti to be their chef and partner. The restaurant reopened just 10 days ago, and it is already clear that Mr. Valenti, the former chef of Alison on Dominick Street in the South Village, has reordered the priorities; when food is this good, it does not really matter who owns the place. Mr. Valenti is not a show-off chef, but he is blessed with the ability to make food really delicious. At the moment his menu is filled with many of the dishes he made famous on Dominick Street; here is his chickpea pancake topped with a tornado of gravlax, and there is his salad of charred lamb with lemon mayonnaise. His skate is on the menu too, perched atop its smoky bed of sauteed cabbage. Mr. Valenti has even brought along his signature lamb shank. There is also a whole range of intriguing pasta dishes like slowly cooked tripe tossed with penne, tomatoes and chili oil. This is robust and original food. When Mr. Valenti announced that he planned to leave Alison, he said he felt it was time for a change. He wanted, he said, to broaden his range. It will be interesting to find out exactly what that means. Cascabel, 218 Lafayette Street, near Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 431-7300. Entrees $14 to $24. Kimchi With Music In Seoul, it is not uncommon to find a pianist playing in a restaurant. Still, it is something of a shock to walk into Kum Gang San in Flushing, Queens, and find the man at the piano playing "Danny Boy" while people at the tables all around are tucking into raw crabs in chile paste and fiery cabbage pickles. This is the restaurant where local Koreans take their American friends, walking them past the waterfall outside and across the little wooden bridge. The regulars don't ask for the menu; they know they want haemul pajun, the large scallion-sprinkled seafood pancake, and bul goki, the sweet beef grilled at the table. They also know they don't want to miss the restaurant's version of steak tartare, a mound of ice-cold beef slicked with sesame and served with crunchy slivers of Korean pear. The quality of the food is superb, and the panchan, the Korean equivalent of antipasto, tend to be more numerous and more diverse than they are in Manhattan. Even if you don't read Korean, ordering is easy: the menu is not only translated into English but is also fully illustrated. Kum Gang San, 138-28 Northern Boulevard, Flushing, Queens, (718) 461-0909. Entrees $7.95 to $14.95.  RUTH REICHL
THE Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, long known for its well-mannered culture, may soon see a battle royal for its top office. In a move intended to give several top managers more responsibilities, Bristol-Myers announced a series of high-level executive appointments yesterday that immediately raised questions on Wall Street. There is no clear line of succession at Bristol-Myers, though Charles A. Heimbold Jr., the chairman and chief executive, plans to retire in 2001, and Kenneth Weg, the company's executive vice president, plans to leave a year earlier. Yesterday's announcement not only failed to answer the succession question, but it also appeared to create a race among several Bristol-Myers executives. ''It does look like there is no heir apparent,'' said David Saks, a managing director at Gruntal & Company. ''What Heimbold is doing is raising a lot of people's titles, giving them more responsibility and then letting the field sort itself out for the chief executive's job.'' As in the Kentucky Derby, this  race is a crowded field. The new responsibilities are effective Dec. 1. Donald J. Hayden Jr., who was president of the intercontinental, worldwide pharmaceuticals group,  was named president of the company's worldwide medicines group. Richard J. Lane, president of United States medicines, will assume new responsibilities for worldwide franchise management and for the consumer medicines businesses in this country and Japan. Christine A. Poon, one of the highest-ranking women in the pharmaceuticals industry, who was president of the medical devices group, will become president of international medicines, reporting to Mr. Hayden. John L. McGoldrick, the company's general counsel, was also named president of the medical devices group. And Michael F. Mee, the chief financial officer, will assume additional responsibilities for global business services. Analysts were quick to peg Mr. Hayden, Mr. McGoldrick and Mr. Mee as front-runners, with disclaimers attached to each. At 42, Mr. Hayden is young to run such a large company, but his pharmaceutical position may be preferred by the board. Analysts say Mr. McGoldrick has a bad assignment because Wall Street has frequently prodded the company to sell the medical devices group. Adding to the odds against Mr. McGoldrick and Mr. Mee, analysts say, are their reputations for being confrontational, unusual for Bristol-Myers's genteel ranks. While Wall Street will keep a close watch, Mr. Heimbold is not amused by the mention of an executive race for his job. He contended that he was merely giving his executives an opportunity to gain more experience. ''These executive changes are one way for us to increase our growth rate and shareholder value,'' Mr. Heimbold said. ''We do focus on competitive superiority. But our goal is to beat our competition.'' The naming of Mr. Heimbold's successor may become more exciting than expected. Analysts noted that Bristol-Myers has no mandatory retirement age for its chairman, which would allow Mr. Heimbold to remain in the post longer than expected. Mr. Heimbold said yesterday that he would not leave the company until a successor was in place. ''A race of this kind is good for the company and good for the shareholders,'' Mr. Saks said. ''At least we know everyone who is involved will be working a little harder.''

With the possible exception of the presidency, no institution in Washington is as closely associated with the Bush family today as the Central Intelligence Agency. Former President George Bush served as C.I.A. director in the Ford administration, and if President Jimmy Carter had taken Mr. Bush up on his offer to stay on as director of central intelligence during Mr. Carter's tenure, the dominos of American political history might have tumbled in quite a different way. Mr. Bush might never have run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980, he might never have been tapped to be Ronald Reagan's running mate, and his son might not be about to become the 43rd president of the United States. As it is, being C.I.A. director was perhaps the elder George Bush's second-favorite job in his long run in government. And when George Bush the younger visits C.I.A. headquarters, he will arrive at a building that bears his family name, the George Bush Center for Intelligence. With so much family history tied up in the place, many observers of the American intelligence community were puzzled by the belated and casual way the Bush transition team let it be known that George J. Tenet, the current C.I.A. director, would be kept on, at least temporarily. Although it appeared to some that the C.I.A. job was treated almost as an afterthought, the decision to keep Mr. Tenet seems to have had much to do with important personal dynamics within the Bush national security circle -- and might reflect the influence of former President Bush. The decision to retain Mr. Tenet was not formally announced by the president-elect or anyone else; instead, Ari Fleischer, the press spokesman, revealed it in response to a reporter's question at a routine briefing earlier this week. As with other personnel matters, the decision to keep Mr. Tenet was made by Mr. Bush and such a small group around him that details of the process remained secret. Even members of the transition team involved in intelligence policy were caught off guard. But several Republicans emphasized that the handling of the decision to keep Mr. Tenet did not reflect a lack of interest in intelligence policy or a lack of other strong candidates, but rather the confluence of events during an odd transition. Mr. Tenet, a Democrat who served as a Congressional staff member and later in the Clinton White House before moving to the C.I.A., does not yet have a relationship with President-elect Bush. Intelligence officials said that Mr. Tenet met with Mr. Bush and other members of the new national security team on Thursday. But he and Mr. Bush have mutual allies. On Capitol Hill, Representative Porter Goss, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, stated publicly that Mr. Bush should keep Mr. Tenet. Mr. Tenet has also developed a good relationship with Eli S. Jacobs, a private investor and former owner of the Baltimore Orioles, who has served on several government panels relating to intelligence and defense and who has been close to a number of C.I.A. officials over the years. Mr. Jacobs, in turn, is close to the Bush family, including the president-elect, who was managing general partner of the Texas Rangers at the same time that Mr. Jacobs owned the Orioles. Mr. Jacobs has been a strong advocate for Mr. Tenet, and appears to be one of the few people who is friends with both President-elect Bush and Mr. Tenet. But, in an interview, Mr. Jacobs said that he played no role in Mr. Bush's decision to keep Mr. Tenet. Clearly, however, Mr. Tenet's most important ally in the new power structure is the senior Mr. Bush, who, as a former president, still receives intelligence briefings. Mr. Tenet presided over the April 1999 ceremony at which the C.I.A. headquarters was renamed for former President Bush; during the ceremony, Mr. Bush heaped praise on Mr. Tenet. Later that year, Mr. Tenet headed a C.I.A.-backed conference on the cold war held at the George Bush presidential library. That conference was packed with veterans of the first Bush administration, including Paul D. Wolfowitz, a defense and foreign policy adviser to the Bush campaign and Vice President-elect Dick Cheney, while former President Bush gave a speech. The elder Mr. Bush has made it clear that he believes the C.I.A. job should be apolitical and removed from the election cycle, as he first suggested to President Carter. In the past, several C.I.A. directors have overlapped administrations, including Allen Dulles, who served under President Dwight D. Eisenhower and stayed on during the first few months of President John F. Kennedy's term. Another was Richard Helms, who served both Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. That is why some Republicans speculate that former President Bush may have told his son that there was no reason to make an immediate change at C.I.A. Indeed, the truncated transition after the Florida recount meant that President-elect Bush had little time to find jobs for several prominent figures within the Republican foreign policy community. Initially, Donald H. Rumsfeld appeared to have been considered for C.I.A. director, but the decision to name him secretary of defense scrambled many of the chess pieces. Mr. Rumsfeld brought a strong presence to the Defense Department, and that in turn seemed to squash plans to name Richard Armitage, a former Defense Department official, to be deputy defense secretary. Mr. Armitage is close to Gen. Colin L. Powell, named to be secretary of state, and Mr. Rumsfeld clearly wanted his own choices at the Pentagon. (Mr. Armitage is now said to be General Powell's choice as deputy secretary of state.) Meanwhile, a spot had to be found for Mr. Wolfowitz, another former Defense Department official who advised the campaign. As a result, the C.I.A. post was left open while the Bush team played musical chairs. Republicans said that Mr. Wolfowitz made it clear that he did not want to serve at the C.I.A., and so instead is expected to be named Mr. Rumsfeld's deputy at the Pentagon. With Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Wolfowitz and Mr. Armitage out of the picture, Mr. Tenet's chances brightened. Perhaps another reason the Bush team has moved cautiously on Mr. Tenet was that one influential senator -- Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence -- said that Mr. Bush should find a new nominee for the C.I.A. post. Senator Shelby's criticism of Mr. Tenet appeared to be based, at least in part, on the way Mr. Tenet handled the investigation into whether the former C.I.A. director, John M. Deutch, improperly placed classified information on unclassified government computers in his home. Mr. Deutch is said to be negotiating now with the Justice Department over whether to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. Some Republicans say that the incoming president's inner circle remains neutral about Mr. Tenet. To keep the job for long, Mr. Tenet will have to develop a comfort level with the new president and his key advisors, one Republican noted. Several Republicans observed that the key test could be the degree to which Mr. Tenet can forge a rapport with Mr. Rumsfeld at the Pentagon. Mr. Rumsfeld developed a deep interest in intelligence when he chaired a commission on the ballistic missile threat two years ago. His panel concluded that emerging nuclear powers could develop ballistic missiles in less time than estimated earlier by the C.I.A., leading to tension with the agency. During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Rumsfeld stated that a close  relationship with the director of central intelligence will be critical to his ability to do his job -- which suggests that Mr. Rumsfeld could be Mr. Tenet's probation officer.

Re ''Transportation Hub at Gabreski Debated'' [Jan. 6]: The idea of transportation hubs on the East End has come up not only in Southampton but in the towns of East Hampton and Riverhead. The traffic problems cannot be viewed in isolation, however, nor can they be adequately addressed by the traditional fixes of widening roads. What needs to occur is a thorough examination of current and future development, based on zoning regulations, demographic patterns and other key indicators. The Sustainable East End Development Strategies (or Seeds) initiative is attempting to do just that, on a regional basis. Actually luring people out of their cars and trucks remains problematic, and agreements about how to develop land to avoid more sprawl will be reached with difficulty. But some version of the transportation hub concept, in combination with increased mass transit, is at least a creative start to a discussion that has too long been put off.

YOUR FUTURE, a new magazine from Time Inc. aimed at readers 40 and younger who are just discovering the importance of personal finance, is anything but tedious -- visually. The first issue, on sale now through June 4, looks like a knock-off of the hot cyber journal, Wired, with articles framed by huge red headlines and sidebars set in greenish type. Obviously the design editors borrowed from Time's Money magazine worked hard to make Your Future inviting, at least to people they think of as visual sophisticates. But Your Future is a snoozer where it counts. Most of the articles are quick takes, and the magazine wastes an amazing amount of ink on feeble attempts at humor. In a feature called Moneysomethings -- "Ideas to fill your head and your wallet" -- Your Future includes a Washington man who's serving a life sentence in prison for running a $2-million-a-week drug ring. The magazine lists baby-sitting and cleaning carpets among 11 second jobs "almost anyone can do" to bolster his or her income. Another feature explains how to choose a PIN, or personal identification number. And it devotes an entire page to answering the burning question, "Is it more expensive to be a woman or a man?" (Not that anyone can choose -- at least not without racking up staggering medical bills.) Enough said. Except it costs $2.50.  RETIREMENT PARADISE.  Find it difficult to get excited about retirement planning? The April issue of Worth contains one of the most absorbing stories on the subject to date. "Paradox Found" is an engaging tale about some ordinary people who didn't plan for retirement and who decided to retire in a land where they expect to be able to afford days of wine and roses: the third world tropics. The writer, Elizabeth Royte, leaves few details untold, refreshing for some readers and disheartening for those who have an interest in retiring someplace warm, lush and cheap. The article teases would-be expatriates but concludes that the life is only for people who have modest expectations and a hearty sense of adventure. People like Ray Steinbach, who has a seemingly ideal life on Roatan, a small island off the coast of Honduras. A divorced, 67-year-old veterinarian from Overton, Neb., Mr. Steinbach spends his days fishing for snapper and grouper, doctoring a few of the locals' animals, scuba diving, napping in the afternoon and dining on his maid's cooking. His is a land, albeit adopted, where car insurance is not required. But other retirees to the island haven't made nearly as smooth a transition. There is animosity between Roatan's locals and some Americans living there. Condos, satellite dishes and even crack cocaine have been imported. And, because of an increasing population, the island is losing its fresh water supply along with its swamps. Ultimately, the article is a testimonial for individual retirement accounts and savvy market plays. BROKER BLUES.  On any list of The Most Stressful Things in Life, choosing a broker should be right up there with moving, changing jobs, buying a home and, of course, going to the dentist. A cloak-and-dagger investigation in the April issue of Money uncovers not only malignant neglect -- brokers who play down risks, who fail to mention fees and who promote products that bring them commissions -- but also disturbing denial by some brokers. Arnold Kraus, an executive vice president of Sutro & Company, tells Money that the brokers the magazine tested may have sensed they were not dealing with legitimate clients. "If it had come down to opening an actual account, as opposed to casual conversation, our representatives certainly would have asked a lot more questions," Mr. Kraus said. The article lists some basic steps to help avoid the bad-broker blues. And it offers readers a valuable score card on some of the brokers in 23 states and the District of Columbia that it contacted. A. G. Edwards & Sons receives the best score among the larger firms, while Edward D. Jones & Company places first among the smaller firms. ROOKIE FUNDS.  Kiplinger's has an intriguing variation on the personal finance mantra "Just Do It" that could be called "Just Do It Carefully." The article describes four fledgling funds that are run by all-star managers who are taking their self-styled thinking and running with it. Kiplinger's seems to know the funds intimately, and the writing is compelling. Caution is advised, though. The magazine discloses that its most promising rookie funds from a year ago have had mixed results: the best a gain of 16 percent and the worst a loss of 14.7 percent. DEFENDING BONDS.  A Smart Money effort to explain the freakish world of bonds, and to suggest a workable strategy to profit in it, provides a steady voice that many investors will appreciate. The timely and exhaustive article explains why bonds are not the scourge of the earth, despite the calamity of 1994. The writer, Robert Barker, attempts to reassure. While a one-percentage-point drop in long-term bond rates over the next year would produce a 21 percent total return for bondholders, he writes, "a one-percentage-point rise in rates would precipitate only a 3 percent loss." Then, he leads a patient discussion on the strategies that a range of investors should consider. This is evenly divided between two portfolio pieces: one for long-term holding and another for speculative trading. The article is packed with information but should be read with a cup of java because it's not as accessible as the opening anecdotes about real-life investing experiences suggest.

Only a day removed from the Giants' catastrophic loss to the Eagles, the details were already fading. By Monday, the hows and whys of a game-killing punt return had become much less important than the realization that a season full of hope was in jeopardy so quickly. At 2-4, the Giants are on the brink of playing themselves out of the playoffs. They are forced to find help for an already vulnerable offensive line as right guard Rich Seubert had surgery for a broken leg, which will put him out of action for seven to eight months. And their next game brings them to the doorstep of a 6-0 Minnesota team enjoying the kind of rousing success the Giants had envisioned for themselves as recently as six weeks ago. Giants Coach Jim Fassel did not try to sugarcoat any of this, even though he is the one bearing most of the heat for his team's falling into those circumstances. ''You can't be throwing flower petals, saying, 'Oh, guys, this is all right,' '' Fassel said. ''The clock is ticking. We need to start winning games.'' The same time-running-out scenario could be extended to Fassel's job security, a recurring theme in recent seasons, when the Giants have gotten off to their traditional slow starts. In Fassel's seven seasons, the Giants have started 1-3, 2-4, 2-3, 3-2, 3-4, 3-4 and 2-4. In three of his first six seasons, the Giants rebounded to make the playoffs. ''Obviously we're frustrated,'' said John Mara, the Giants' executive vice president. ''But we still have a lot of the season left and we still have confidence in the team and the staff. We're hopeful that we can turn it around.'' What makes the start to this season more jarring, though, are the high expectations that came with the feeling that the Giants had their most talented offensive team in years, if not ever. The front office had upgraded the special teams talent, and the draft had added depth to a strong defense. ''Just because you've got potential, that doesn't mean nothing,'' defensive tackle Keith Hamilton said. ''Potential will get you out of a job real fast. You don't win games on what you should do.'' Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi also continues to support Fassel, even though he commented in The Boston Globe last weekend that the impact of coaches has become more important in the salary-cap age, using Bill Parcells's turnaround of the Cowboys as an example. Accorsi said he did not mean that to reflect poorly on Fassel, but he would not elaborate on the job Fassel is doing. ''I am not going to comment on our season while it's going on,'' Accorsi said. ''It's not my place. I'm not going to interfere with the coach's job.'' Accorsi does have personnel issues to deal with this week. Seubert's injury creates more problems for an already thin offensive line. The majority of the Giants' free-agent signings were made to bolster the special teams, but in that equation the team lost two starting offensive linemen (Jason Whittle and Mike Rosenthal) and its best blocking tight end (Dan Campbell), all of whom signed with other teams. With Seubert out, three rookies fill starting spots and another player will be signed this week to fill Seubert's roster spot. With all that, though, the Giants still have to face an uphill task, starting with a game against the Vikings. Minnesota is one of the teams being noticed for a coach-inspired turnaround. Last season, the Vikings started 0-4 and were 3-10 before winning their final three games. The most remarkable turnaround has come on their defense, which has a new coordinator in George O'Leary. With much the same personnel that gave up 27.6 points a game last season, the Vikings have cut that to 17.3. ''Beating them would go a long way,'' Giants defensive end Michael Strahan said. ''We have to go in there with the attitude that we can't afford to not come out of there with a victory.'' Fassel has found a magic button several times before, once by guaranteeing the team would make the playoffs. ''He's a fighter,'' Hamilton said of Fassel. ''He's not going to lay down. Until the time's up, we're going down kicking and screaming.'' Strahan said: ''He's just honest with you and he doesn't allow you to quit. As long as you have those things, you have a chance.''

Glynn Milburn got Stanford close and Tommy Vardell finished the job by rushing for three touchdowns, two in the fourth quarter, as the Cardinal stung Colorado, 28-21, today. Colorado (2-2) lost quarterback Darian Hagan with 12 minutes 1 second left when he was sacked and injured his left knee. There was no immediate report on the severity of the injury. Milburn broke free on a 55-yard run to position the Cardinal (1-2) at the Colorado 28-yard line. Two plays later, Vardell, behind a block by tackle Bob Whitfield, swept 20 yards around left end for his second touchdown with 13 minutes 9 seconds remaining. Vardell's third touchdown, a 7-yard run, came with 6:37 remaining and followed a Stanford recovery of a fumble by Lamont Warren. Washington 56, Kansas St. 3 SEATTLE (AP) -- Billy Joe Hobert threw for three touchdowns, two to Mario Bailey, and Jay Barry ran for two touchdowns as Washington (3-0) dealt Kansas State (3-1) its first loss. (Washington was ranked No. 1 by The New York Times in the preseason top 20.) In three quarters, Hobert completed 13 of 18 passes for 234 yards. Beno Bryant's fourth punt return for a touchdown tied the Pacific-10 Conference record set by U.C.L.A.'s Sam Brown from 1953 to 1955. His career punt-return yardage of 770 yards is a Washington record. Miami 34, Tulsa 10 TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Stephen McGuire scored twice and Gino Torretta threw two short touchdown passes for Miami (3-0). Torretta, who completed 20 of 33 passes for 327 yards, threw for touchdowns of 1 and 3 yards as the Hurricanes broke the game open in the second quarter by scoring three touchdowns in 6 minutes 22 seconds. Tulsa fell to 3-2. Oklahoma 27, Virginia Tech 17 NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Cale Gundy threw for one touchdown, ran for another and set a school passing record for Oklahoma (3-0). Gundy's 3-yard run late in the third quarter gave the Sooners (3-0) a 27-10 lead, and Oklahoma then held off a late rally by the Hokies (1-3). Gundy's 18 completions broke the record of 15 set by Jack Mildren against Nebraska in 1969. His 31 attempts tied the school record, which has stood since 1938. Gundy's 235 yards were 11 short of the school record. Oklahoma had only 145 yards rushing, 205 below its average. Colorado St. 28, Hawaii 16 FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- Kevin Verdugo and Greg Primus hooked up on two touchdown passes, and Primus set a school record with 256 receiving yards as Colorado State (2-3 over all, 1-1 in the conference) snapped a three-game losing streak in the Western Athletic Conference game. Primus had a career-high 10 catches, and his 256 yards broke the previous Colorado State single-game record of 219 yards by Jeff Champine against Northern Colorado in 1983. Hawaii is 3-2, 2-1. B.Y.U. 21, Air Force 7 PROVO, Utah (AP) -- Ty Detmer threw for two touchdowns to second-string receiver Otis Sterling for Brigham Young (1-3, 1-0) in the Western Athletic Conference game. Air Force fell to 4-1, 3-1. Detmer completed 20 of 30 passes for 340 yards with one interception. B.Y.U. finished with 529 total yards to 280 for Air Force. Wyoming 28, Texas-El Paso 28 LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A mishandled snap by Wyoming's Derek Palmer botched a 33-yard field-goal attempt with 10 seconds to play in the Western Athletic Conference game. Wyoming (2-2-1, 0-1-1) had led by 21-0. Texas-El Paso is 3-1-1, 1-0-1). COLLEGE FOOTBALL: WEST/SOUTHWEST
Now that the Republican leaders in the Senate have finished wasting the nation's time over a constitutional ban on gay marriage, we're bracing for Act Two of the culture-war circus that the White House is staging to get out the right-wing vote this fall. Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, plans to continue to set aside work on pressing issues facing the country to vote on yet another unworthy constitutional amendment -- a prohibition on burning the American flag. If the gay marriage amendment was a pathetic attempt to change the subject in an election year, the flag-burning proposal is simply ridiculous. At least there actually is a national debate about marriage, and many thousands of gay couples want to wed. Flag burning is an issue that exists only for the purpose of pandering to a tiny slice of voters. Supporters of the amendment cannot point to a single instance of anti-American flag burning in the last 30 years. The video images that the American Legion finds so offensive to veterans and other Americans are either of Vietnam-era vintage or from other countries. Nevertheless, flag burning remains one of those ''wedge issues'' that Republicans use to denigrate the patriotism of Democratic candidates or to get the party's base out to vote. The other big difference between the two amendments is that the ban on gay marriage was never going to get the two-thirds vote in Congress required to send it to the states for ratification. Yesterday, the Senate rejected it by 49 to 48, with the help of seven Republicans. The flag-burning amendment, on the other hand, actually could pass. A realistic nose count based on members' public statements and how they voted when the measure last came up, in 2000, suggests the Senate may be just a single vote short of punching a hole in free speech. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, should be rallying Democrats to join the small handful of principled Republicans so far willing to oppose the amendment. But as things stand, he is among the Democrats who plan to vote for this constitutional vandalism. Opponents of the amendment, like Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, are standing on firm ground in trying to protect the Bill of Rights from an election-year stunt. It is the patriotic thing to do. Editorial

Starting today they are finally together, on the second floor of the Revlon International Building, 625 Madison Avenue (58th Street). FOR years Christian Jussel, Garrick Stephenson and Janet Mavec discussed putting their respective East Side antiques shops under one roof. Starting today they are finally together, on the second floor of the Revlon International Building, 625 Madison Avenue (58th Street). Mr. Jussel's gallery, Vernay & Jussel, specializes in English furniture; Mr. Stephenson carries 18th- and early-19th-century French and continental furniture and works of art, and Ms. Mavec specializes in 18th- and 19th-century English silver and jewelry. Each dealer has a separate space and a distinctive look. Robert Currie designed Vernay & Jussel, which Mr. Jussel called ''cool and tailored.'' Kitty Hawks helped Ms. Mavec give her gallery the look of a serene living room with large Edwardian cabinets. And Mr. Stephenson designed his own shop, a labyrinth of linked spaces like an English garden.
THE video for Beastie Boys' ''Ch-Check It Out'' -- from ''To the 5 Boroughs,'' which in June will be the trio's first album in six years -- is a rat-a-tat montage of images ripped from cheesy 70's TV shows. The group has always been fond of Sansabelt-and-sideburns nostalgia, most notably in Spike Jonze's brazenly energizing 1994 video for ''Sabotage,'' which cast the Beasties as slick gunslingers from a ''Streets of San Francisco''-style cop show. ''Sabotage'' stands as the perfect metaphor for the Beasties' style, most notably their valiant fight to keep old-style rap from sounding, well, old. The Beasties have always looked both backward and forward; they know that by recontextualizing a rerun, you can make it new. Which is why it's so disappointing that the ''Ch-Check It Out'' video feels reran in all the wrong ways. Directed by one of the Beasties -- Adam Yauch, operating as his alter-ego Nathanial Hornblower -- the video makes a desperate grab for the uncorked vitality of ''Sabotage,'' but it doesn't hang together as a narrative, not even a Dada one. ''Ch-Check'' opens with the Beasties beaming down, ''Star Trek''-style (in the old stretch-jersey and highwater-pants uniforms, to boot), onto a deserted city street. We see them dressed as ironic versions of doctors, engineers and indistinct business guy types, wearing button-down shirts and brandishing coffee mugs. We also see them, inexplicably, as Everglades adventurers, beleaguered by alligators who snap at them. Elsewhere the Beasties appear as retro-mod versions of themselves, wearing headphones and baggy zippered jackets. A film crew follows as they strut down cracked sidewalks, past graffiti-laced buildings. This is 80's New York reinvented as a down-and-out theme park -- possibly an affectionate nod to the dirtier, more dangerous city of yore, which gave birth to hip-hop in the first place. These streets aren't safe even for the Beasties: they're assaulted first by a blue-haired lady (she throws a fish at them) and then by a businessman (who threatens to beat them with a baguette). These characters are played by the Beasties themselves (in addition to Mr. Yauch, who raps under the name MCA, there's Adam Horovitz's Ad-Rock and Michael Diamond's Mike D), but they're clearly meant to represent duffers who disapprove of Beastieness. The raps in ''Ch-Check It Out,'' set against a latticework of angular, old-fashioned breakdance beats, whip by faster than you can process the words. But in the bits that come through, you can hear the Beasties bragging, justifiably, that they've stuck around without getting complacent. The song is exuberant and bracingly youthful-sounding. But the video is a fishy slap in the face to the old folks who still don't get it. When you've been around, as the Beasties have, for more than 20 years, exactly who are the old folks? The Beastie Boys have survived by never standing still: with their innovative production values, proficiency on their own instruments and brain-teaser use of sampling, not to mention their snarky wordplay, they've rooted out infinite variations on old-school hip-hop. So what's with the dangerous baguette-play? If the Beasties have to worry about anything, it's not the disapproval of old folks, but the lack of interest of younger hip-hop fans. The sight of the Beasties in glued-on mustaches and helmet hair looks retrograde in 2004. And their insolent image isn't one that ages particularly well. Sneering at the camera, defending yourselves against grown-ups. Even when those tropes are trotted out with punky wit, as they are here, they're still frazzled around the edges, particularly coming from artists who are just around the bend from middle age. Frenetic and disorganized, the video for ''Ch-Check It Out'' shows the Beastie Boys moving as fast as they can but going nowhere at all.

Investors snapped up $2 billion in bonds yesterday to finance an extension of the No. 7 subway line to the Far West Side, according to city officials. An official said $1.35 billion of the proceeds will go to subway construction. The rest will be used to buy property for the project and for other aspects of West Side development. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will build the 1.1-mile extension from Times Square to 11th Avenue and 34th Street. WILLIAM NEUMAN

One of the prefight promotional slogans for the middleweight title bout between Felix Trinidad and William Joppy was ''History in the Making.'' There may not have been history made in the ring last night at Madison Square Garden, but there is every chance that Trinidad's convincing victory over Joppy will be seen as another rousing chapter in a flourishing legend. Trinidad added the World Boxing Association championship just after midnight last night with his fifth-round technical knockout of Joppy, a stunning display of punching power in his first fight as a middleweight. Trinidad knocked down Joppy in the first and fourth rounds and sent him to the canvas again with consecutive right hands as the fighters stood in the middle of the ring in the fifth round. Joppy wobbled to his feet but staggered across the ring. Referee Arthur Mercante Jr. stopped the fight with 35 seconds remaining in the round. ''I have never been hit like that before,'' Joppy said. ''He's a great champion. I never thought he could hit like that. I didn't think he would have that much power coming up from 154 pounds.'' For Trinidad (40-0), it was the third different weight-class title he has won in just three years. In 1999, Trinidad won the World Boxing Council welterweight title. He added the superwelterweight championship last year, then won the middleweight title in his first fight at 160 pounds. ''I always knew I was a middleweight,'' Trinidad said. ''You all saw it tonight. I am a true middleweight. I beat the best middleweight tonight and I will beat Bernard Hopkins.'' Trinidad will fight Hopkins in September in a bout to unify the middleweight titles. ''I knew I was going to knock him out,'' he added. ''I like knockouts and I look for knockouts.'' It was Joppy (32-2-1) who threw the first big punch of the fight, a chopping right hand in the first 30 seconds, and Joppy forced the action. But as the round went on, Trinidad seemed to get his feet under him more. Joppy missed a right hand and Trinidad countered with a left hook flush on Joppy's jaw. Joppy looked stunned and Trinidad followed with two good right hands. Joppy fought back but was clearly hurt by the Trinidad assault. Trinidad chased Joppy into a corner and landed a sweeping left hook, then another. Trinidad landed a right hand and another stinging left hook that sent Joppy falling backward with 12 seconds left in the first round. Joppy was up at the count of five and held on to survive the round. Trinidad controlled the action early in the second round but Joppy started to return more punches. Joppy was active and pressing Trinidad, but it was Trinidad who was scoring more jabs and counterpunching as Joppy's face grew red. In the third round, Joppy seemed to be fighting frantically, throwing 116 punches in the round. The action was even between the fighters, especially with Joppy scoring to Trinidad's body, but Trinidad still appeared in command and had more firepower. Two right hands and a left hook sent Joppy tumbling backward on his back and neck with 2:03 left in the fourth round. Joppy was up right away and again held on, fighting back to survive the round. At the start of the fifth round, Joppy was stunned early by a crisp right hand from Trinidad. Joppy was undaunted again, but near the round's end, ran into consecutive right hands that Trinidad landed on Joppy's jaw. It was a festive atmosphere inside the Garden when Trinidad entered the ring. Thousands of fans were waving Puerto Rican flags, beating drums and shaking noisemakers in the grandstand. The crowd of 18,235 was not a sellout, but nearly so, and upon Trinidad's arrival, the Garden was filled with chants of Trinidad's nickname, Tito. As the challenger to Joppy's championship, Trinidad entered the ring first. In a strange setting, the anthems of Puerto Rico and the United States were sung with Joppy still in his dressing room. The United States anthem was also drowned out by drumming, noisemakers and a chorus of boos. Hasim Rahman, a friend of Joppy's from the Washington-Baltimore area, joined Joppy in the ring before the fight and held aloft one of Joppy's championship belts. On the undercard, Chris Byrd (33-2) won the United States Boxing Association heavyweight championship with a unanimous decision over Maurice Harris, a fighter from Newark. Harris announced his retirement from boxing after the loss. In a fight that lacked for action throughout, Byrd, the former World Boxing Organization champion, took command in the fourth round over a tiring Harris, who fell to 18-11-2. There was one knockdown in the bout. With less than a minute left in the sixth round, Byrd decked Harris with a solid left in the stomach and a glancing left hook to the head. But while Byrd continued to press the action in succeeding rounds, he was not scoring crisply. Harris was clearly tired and occasionally wobbly, but Byrd was slowing, too. Byrd landed a series of undistinguished punches for the rest of the fight. Byrd said he expected to face the heavyweight David Tua next. Vernon Forrest won the vacant I.B.F. welterweight championship earlier with a unanimous decision over Raul Frank. Forrest improved his record to 32-0-1 with 26 knockouts. Frank, who was the I.B.F's No. 1 contender, has a 23-4-1 record. PUNCH LINES In a televised interview before the Trinidad-Joppy fight, HASIM RAHMAN, the W.B.C. and I.B.F. heavyweight champion, explained his decision to sign DON KING as his new promoter, a move that has led to a series of lawsuits. ''Don King gave me the best deal,'' Rahman said. ''They won't force me just because they're threatening to take me to court. They're not the champions anymore.'' BOXING
The employees of Alexander's department store gathered for their farewell supper around the long narrow tables at Tony Roma's, a mile down the road from the discount store where many of them had worked since it opened in 1967. Over spareribs and potatoes, they exchanged hugs and phone numbers, and a certain grim view of the future. There was Maureen Murphy, 41 years old and single, who had started working in the store before Christmas 25 years ago and never left. Now, she feared more than anything losing her home in Rosedale, Queens, just seven years shy of paying off the mortgage. There was Ronald Alexander, 29, who laughed with the long-haired beauty from the camera department and wondered whether they would still be together in six months. He'd worked in Alexander's during high school, traveled to Germany with the Army, and came back to a job in the stockroom. Alexander's has not announced when its 11 stores will close, but the death of the 65-year-old department-store chain is hurling 5,600 employees into an unwelcome job market in a field hit hard by an unforgiving recession. Impact on the Retail Industry While talk of unemployment often focuses on the loss of factory jobs, the recession has had an even greater impact on the wholesale and retail industry. Since 1988, according to the State Labor Department, New York City and the surrounding counties have lost more than 171,000 jobs in the wholesale and retail industry, falling to 890,000 from 1,061,600. "It's the No. 1 source of decline during the past several years," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, New York regional commissioner at the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "We've never seen a recession take this kind of a toll in the service industry." Retailing tends to employ a large number of workers at either end of the age spectrum. The older workers at Alexander's, many of them part timers, are too young to retire but fear no one will hire them. They are terrified of losing severance pay, pensions and other benefits they had counted on to ease them into retirement. The young, for whom unemployment is now at its highest level in 25 years, also wonder if they will be able to find jobs, even if they try new fields, though some are excited about the challenge. "The employees of Alexander's are going to be competing in a labor market that is very difficult for new entries," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center. Statewide, unemployment last month was 7.9 percent. "There could be no worse time to add to the labor supply than right now," Mr. Moss said. If they are entering a job market that is all but lifeless, the employees at Valley Stream are leaving a store that each day descends further from the tidy divisions they once tended into retail hell. Scrawled signs announce that the third and fourth floors are closed to customers. The second floor is a grab bag of appliances scattered around the escalator. The first floor is mayhem: women's skirts and artificial flowers in the men's department, patio umbrellas in lingerie, boxes torn open and the parts of lamps and fans strewn about, stuffed animals with the eyes pulled out. "I still can't believe that it's gone," Ms. Murphy said. "I walk through the store devastated. Customers just come in to say goodbye, not even to buy things." When Ms. Murphy began at Alexander's, she was a high school student of 16 picking up extra cash around Christmas. Her supervisor, pleased with her work, recommended that she stay on. She never left. She progressed swiftly at Alexander's to become manager of the women's dress department before she was 20. "It's like a family-oriented type of store," she said, and glanced at her co-workers, laughing and putting their arms around one another's shoulders at the dinner tables. "You see how it is." A trim woman in a button-down shirt and pants, short hair brushed back in a no-nonsense cut, Ms. Murphy has so far gone on two job interviews: tense encounters relieved only by the sympathy of the recruiters. "They know the situation with Alexander's, that it wasn't your fault," she said. Ms. Murphy and other employees began to suspect the store would go bankrupt after Christmas, when the receiving department screeched to a standstill. But they thought bankruptcy would be a gentler matter, involving the closing of a few stores or a reorganization of the company's debt. None expected the entire chain to fall. In a sense, Mr. Moss of N.Y.U. said, Alexander's was the retail equivalent of the post office, offering flexibility, opportunities to advance within the company and above all, job security. Ms. Murphy now worries about paying her bills and making her mortgage, but she hopes to avoid taking a job in desperation. For her, strength came in what she remembers as, simply, "the call," from her older brother in Pennsylvania. "He said everything right: 'I'm here. Whatever you need, don't worry,' " Ms. Murphy remembered. " 'Sometimes things work out for the best.' " She is thinking of leaving the retail trade, which no longer offers the security it once did, and considers retraining for a career in medicine, an avocation until now. At the Rosedale Volunteer Ambulance Corps, she is known as Lieutenant Murphy. "That's something I enjoy doing," she said, "and with retailing being so iffy, you want to make sure the job you take is secure enough that you don't have to worry where your next check is coming from." She does not know how long her resolve will last. "I'm trying to have a positive attitude," Ms. Murphy said. "As long as I have my health and can get by, I leave it all in God's hands." Nearing the End Of a First Job As a high school student from nearby Rosedale, Queens, Ronald Alexander's first job was working in the receiving room at the Valley Stream store. He stayed there two years. In his 20's, he joined the Air Force, dabbled in college and traveled. And then he returned home to Alexander's, where the same man who had hired him as a teen-ager offered him another job. Mr. Alexander had hoped to build a career at Valley Stream, where his hourly wage rose to $6.50, from $5.25, in just the year since his return. His boss affectionately refers to him as "my son," and Mr. Alexander, who is 30, once hoped to become store director just like him. "It's my family," Mr. Alexander said. "My first job, and I'm closing the store." Mr. Alexander has interviewed with other retailers, like Caldor and A & S, that have come to recruit at Alexander's. He has no way of gauging his prospects. "Out here, you got 300 people going for the same job and they're all qualified," Mr. Alexander lamented. "It's luck, really." His sweetheart from the camera department, who did not want to be identified, seemed undisturbed by the closing. She is studying to be a pharmacist and expects to look for an internship at a pharmacy after summer school. Mr. Alexander considers returning to school, but is ruling it out for the moment for lack of money. His real hope, he said, is to get a loan so he can open a convenience store or a liquor store between the Green Acres Shopping Mall and his home in Laurelton, Queens. If that doesn't come through, Mr. Alexander is prepared to accept something else. His minimum requirement for a job: "I have to like it, at least a little bit." A One-Two Punch Leads to Fear Gladys Cayea, a 15-year employee, is not given to self-pity. To beat the cancer that claimed half her stomach and left her with a lung tumor, she had to be tough. Now, she is scared. More than the $100 she earned for 20 hours a week as a cashier, Mrs. Cayea counted on Alexander's for the medical benefits that saved her and her husband, Jack, from financial ruin during her illnesses. In February, the retailer told employees it would no longer provide medical insurance. To continue the comprehensive coverage she had, Mrs. Cayea would have to pay $3,536 a year, nearly her entire net salary. Now, she does not expect to find another job. "Who's going to hire somebody that's going to be 64 years old?" she asked. "If I can manage the way I am, I'll collect unemployment and severance pay. We'll just have to make things work out." She tries not to dwell on the tenuous road to October 1994, when she will turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare. Deep reflection brings anxiety, heart palpitations. "If I start thinking about what's going to happen, I get myself all worked up and nervous," she said. "I just take it as it comes along." Jack Cayea served 33 months in the Army, fixing vehicles in Europe during World War II. He and Gladys married after his return and had two children. He worked as a produce manager at Bohack's until 1973, when the first of two heart bypass operations forced him to stop working at the age of 50. There were good years. In 1964, the family moved here from Woodhaven, Queens. Two weeks each summer, they rented a cottage in Vermont. At that time, Mr. Cayea said, he expected his retirement years to be free of these worries. "Sometimes things don't work out the way you want them to, but you have to take life the way it comes," he said. Young, Unworried And Looking Ahead Zenia Sneed, 20, did not worry the day Alexander's announced its closing. She saw in it her escape to a new future. "I was going to leave one day, but that day wasn't coming fast enough for me," she said. "But now it's sad," Lynette Smith broke in. Ms. Smith, 21, periodically tempered her younger friend's brazen declarations. "It'd survived the Depression, it'd been around forever." "Yeah, on the news it said, 'Alexander's will be missed.' They made it real sad," Ms. Sneed said. "But to tell you the truth, I think people were ashamed to shop here. I'd see, whenever they'd have bags from A & S or Macy's, they'd put the Alexander's bag inside that, so it wouldn't show on the outside." Ms. Sneed is finishing high school and hopes to collect unemployment benefits for the summer, then attend Brooklyn Technical College. She wants to be a police officer, preferably for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, because, she says, that is the safest branch of police work. Ms. Smith, a graduate of Springfield Gardens High School in Queens, plans to return to school for training in the health professions. She is alarmed at the job prospects ahead and has taken Civil Service exams for clerical work, though city government jobs are shrinking also. "There's jobs out there, but it's kind of hard," she said. "It's a recession. It's not going to be easy."

The Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund filed four lawsuits yesterday on behalf of six Sikh and Bangladeshi laborers who are seeking to win thousands of dollars in what they claim are unpaid wages from five construction contractors. The suits -- one filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, two in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and one in State Supreme Court in Queens -- accuse the companies of breach of contract and violations of minimum-wage laws at construction sites, including a veterans hospital in Northport and a residential building in the Bronx.

LEAD: BULB planting continues. Don't forget to mow the lawn; mowers are set to cut high, but the last cut will be shorter to about one-inch. Rake leaves off lawns and add them to compost, flower borders or vegetable patches. Dig, dry and store tender bulbs, such as caladiums and tuberous begonias, if tops have been weakened by frost. BULB planting continues. Don't forget to mow the lawn; mowers are set to cut high, but the last cut will be shorter to about one-inch. Rake leaves off lawns and add them to compost, flower borders or vegetable patches. Dig, dry and store tender bulbs, such as caladiums and tuberous begonias, if tops have been weakened by frost.  Into the Ground Some thoughts and suggestions on bulb planting may be helpful now. Be practical when making planting plans and choose named varieties carefully, especially of tulips. For example, if a display of yellow and red tulips is planned, nothing can be more disheartening than seeing the tulips bloom weeks apart. Be sure the varieties chosen will bloom simultaneously. Buy generously. Err on the side of too many bulbs and plant enough to make a show. Never plant too few. And never, never plant bulbs in one row. The flowers will look ridiculous come spring. Plant in clumps, circles or random scatterings. When planting, don't forget to set bulbs right side up. The bottom is usually flat and the top is usually pointed. If there is any doubt, especially with smaller bulbs, plant them sideways; at least they will have a chance. A planting suggestion. Some gardeners have great success by digging an entire bed for bulbs and adding a sprinkling of bulb food on the bottom. Work the fertilizer in with a rake, so it does not touch the bulbs directly. Then bulbs are placed on the soil and covered over with more soil, which is tamped firmly. This sort of planting can also be done in layers with the larger bulbs set eight inches or so deep and covered over with a few inches of soil. Smaller bulbs can then be placed over them. The entire bed is covered over with soil. Sometimes this sort of planting provides wonderful spring surprises of flower color. Several disappointments occur when planting bulbs. One in particular comes if the bulbs have dried out. This often happens with small bulbs such as those of eranthis, anemones and puschkinia. But the problem is easy to solve. Soak small bulbs in lukewarm water for about a hour just before planting. This plumps them up and encourages roots to grow after the bulbs are planted. One thing many gardeners forget about is the after-bloom nuisance of some foliage. Remember not all bulb foliage ripens at the same time. It can linger on and on and make a nuisance of itself especially if other plants are waiting to be set out in spring. Particularly troublesome are the floppy leaves of anemones (windflowers), some scillas and alliums and all narcissus. Tulips and hyacinths seem to be rapid in ripening their foliage. If remaining foliage is going to be troublesome next spring, don't plant the bulbs where urgent spring planting must go on. If squirrels, skunks or chipmunks dig up bulbs, there is no sure solution, only suggestions. Tamp the soil firmly after planting; rodents are often curious to know why soil has been disturbed and they may dig it up to find out. After tamping soil lightly, water gently and cover the earth with leaves. For added insurance, place cayenne pepper or chili spices around the area to discourage foraging. Or cover the newly planted area with chicken-wire screen to keep unwanted paws out. If all of the above fails, plant daffodils. At least, these bulbs are never dug up. The bulbs are poisonous, if ingested, and contain the toxin lycorine and related alkaloids.  QUESTIONS/ANSWERS  BLACK WALNUT Last year I tried growing black walnut trees from nuts. Like a squirrel, I thought, I buried the nuts an inch or so deep in soil and this spring, not a single shoot. What did I do wrong? B.P., York, Pa. Try again and place the nuts more deeply - several inches. Was the black walnut protected from rodents, especially squirrels, with a wire screen covering? Fully ripe, black walnuts can be set in the ground directly to germinate in spring. They need the cold winter period outdoors to stir the dormant embryo in the seed. Commercial production of black walnut saplings for nursery sale is usually done either by grafting established cultivars on sturdy rootstocks or by rooting cuttings.  NO DAHLIAS This spring I purchased dahlia tubers from a reputable nursery. They produced foliage, but no flowers. I mixed topsoil, peat moss and cow manure before planting and fertilized them with a foliar feed. What was lacking in their diet? R.T., Manhattan. Nothing. In fact, the dahlias may have been overfed. Foliage but no flowers usually indicates that the soil was too rich and the dahlia tubers were over-cared for. Also, dahlia tubers may have been dried out at point of purchase and were not in top condition when planted. Try again next year, in the same place where the soil should need no amendments. Avoid foliar feeding, at least at the start.  PATIO MOSS We have a brick patio on the north side of the house. Moss grows there and is especially slippery in winter. How can we correct this situation? A.T., Oradell, N.J. This is a frequent question and the solution is simple. A commercial product ''Moss & Algae Killer for Roofs, Decks and Patios'' is made by Safer, Inc. headquartered in Newton, Mass. The product is made from natural fatty-acids and is sold as a concentrate or in a ready-to-use applicator. It is available at well-stocked garden centers or some hardware stores and can be applied any time, but read and follow label directions.

Stung by accounting scandals, institutional investors in several states are pushing for greater transparency and disclosure not just from public companies, but from private equity and venture capital firms, which have long operated outside the public eye. On Friday, the University of Texas published the financial performance of all its investments -- including venture capital funds. The disclosure came over the fierce objection of some of the venture capitalists, with whom the university signed confidentiality agreements promising not to disclose the figures. Bob Bardt, the chief executive of the University of Texas Investment Management Company, said that the fund came under pressure from elected officials and the local media. Proponents relied on state law that requires disclosure of returns for public investments. (The University of Texas is a public university.) He acknowledged that there were disadvantages to such disclosure. The returns from private equity investments can be misleading, he noted, typically appearing dismal for the first several years after they have been made, but then picking up as the start-up companies in which a fund has invested become profitable. ''Some of the returns for young venture partnerships look very, very bad, but they might not turn out to be so bad,'' Mr. Bardt said, echoing concerns of venture capitalists, including some who he said threatened legal action to stop the disclosure. ''These are long-term investments, and they are difficult to interpret in the short run.'' A related situation is unfolding in Massachusetts. There, the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board, which handles retirement funds for state teachers and employees, has received requests to disclose its private equity investment performance. The board has also received threats of legal action from venture capitalists and is pondering how to proceed, according to Mike Travaglini, the state's deputy treasurer. In Texas, Mark G. Yudof, chancellor of the University of Texas system, said that the university's investments should be ''publicly accountable.'' He predicted that more public institutions will follow suit, particularly in light of the recent spate of accounting scandals. Mr. Yudof said that he did not share Mr. Bardt's worry that some venture capital firms would be less willing to accept investments from the university out of fear their rates of return would be disclosed. If that were the case, Mr. Yudof said, the university should be willing, if necessary, to invest in funds that offer a lower rate of return but that do not shy away from disclosure. ''You have public obligations,'' he said. ''If it means you have to cut your rate of return by half a percent, we have to learn to live with it.'' In its disclosure, the university investment management company -- which has $13.7 billion in assets under management, just under 12 percent of it in private equity -- reported returns that show that its venture investments indeed perform much more strongly over time. In its General Endowment Fund, the university's 10-year rate of return from private equity was 16.21 percent; however, its one-year rate of return was a negative 17.81 percent, and the three-year rate of return was 1.54 percent. The 125 active equity partnerships in which the university has holdings include some from major Silicon Valley venture capitalists. Foundation Capital has had a rate of return of negative 28 percent since Texas pledged money to the fund in 2001. Advanced Technology Ventures has had a rate of return of negative 33 percent since 2001. Both those firms have invested only a small fraction of the capital committed by the university, according to Trey Thompson, managing director of the university investment management company. Neither of the venture capital firms returned calls seeking comment. Some venture capitalists said that the move toward more disclosure would prove difficult to resist. ''I think this is an inevitable outcome for a maturing asset class,'' said David Spreng, a managing partner with Crescendo Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif. The returns on its funds, according to the Texas disclosure, ranged from 25 percent for an investment made in 1997 to negative 46 percent for an investment made in 2000. Though Mr. Spreng said he was concerned that the data could be misinterpreted, he added that ''we're not going to fight'' the demands for disclosure. One investment organization that is seen as a bellwether in the field, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as Calpers, has gone in the other direction. About eight months ago, Calpers reversed a long-time policy of disclosing the investment performance of individual private equity investments. ''The numbers weren't doing justice to us or our partners,'' said Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for Calpers. People who are not intimately familiar with the private equity industry, he added, ''don't understand the numbers and what they mean.''
To the Editor: ''Crave Thin Mints? Girl Scout Cookies Available on eBay'' (front page, March 13) brings another fine example of adults' treading on the innocence of their children. The Girl Scouts teach values like fair play, honesty and working to make the world better. Adults do a disservice by trying to find a ''loophole'' that lets them sell cookies online. Sure, I had extra cookies from my daughter's sale last year. We took them to the local soup kitchen and women's shelter.

Prudential Investment Management Inc. will close two of its three equity mutual funds in Japan because of competition. The company will shut its Prudential Quality Japan fund and PRU PM Wizard fund and return the money to investors. The company's president, Masahiko Sasaki, told Bloomberg News that 17 jobs would be eliminated. Prudential plans to focus more on its fixed-income business and is reducing its equity offerings despite the nearly 40 percent rise in the Nikkei 225 since late April. Ken Belson (NYT)
A 33-year-old woman was killed this morning after she sat down in front of an oncoming train clutching her infant daughter, who survived, the authorities said.. Witnesses said the woman, Deborah E. Kahn, lifted the child from a stroller, stepped off of the platform, and crouched at the center of the tracks as two dozen commuters stood by helpless and horrified. Ms. Kahn, who lived in nearby Ridgewood, N.J., with her husband, Michael Koenig, was declared dead at the scene, the police said. The girl, identified as Alison, was taken to Hackensack University Medical Center, where she remains in fair condition, said Peggy Schunk, a hospital spokeswoman. John L. Molinelli, the Bergen County prosecutor, said that Ms. Kahn had apparently planned to kill herself and the baby. ''Although the investigation is continuing, it appears at this time that she intended to commit suicide and most probably intended to have the life of the child taken as well,'' he said. Diana Frering, who lives across the street from Ms. Kahn's home, said Ms. Kahn, who had recently moved to New Jersey with her family, would come over for coffee occasionally. ''She talked longingly of her cramped apartment in New York City,'' Ms. Frering said, adding that Ms. Kahn had a young child when she moved in a few months ago, and the two women would talk about their children. ''She came from New York City and came to the suburbs, and I'm sure it's a big adjustment.'' A few neighbors said they had not seen Ms. Kahn or her family in the past couple of days. Former neighbors of Ms. Kahn on East 34th Street in Manhattan recalled how happy she was when her baby was born this summer. ''She was a spirited woman,'' said Karen Chiavetta. ''I never knew her to be depressed. She was so looking forward to having the baby.'' Ms. Kahn's husband really wanted to move to a house, and Ms. Kahn wanted to have the baby in New York City, before they left for the suburbs, she said. Another former neighbor of Ms. Kahn's said she visited Ms. Kahn four days after she came home from the hospital with her baby. ''She was ecstatic; she had just had the baby and it was beautiful,'' the woman said. ''They moved to New Jersey and got a Volvo -- that's such a safety car.'' The westbound train, on the New Jersey Transit's Main Line, was traveling from Hoboken, N.J., to Suffern, N.Y., as it pulled into the station around 10:15 a.m. A crew member pulled the baby from beneath the train and took her inside a passenger car until emergency crews arrived, officials said. The Ho Ho Kus station, a quaint fieldstone building in this affluent commuter town of 4,000 people, remained closed this afternoon. The train stood in the station most of the day as investigators paced the platform or stood near Ms. Kahn's body, which was removed at 1:45 p.m. Shortly after the incident, 20 passengers who were on the No. 1109 were transferred to the another train, and no other delays were reported. It was the 27th death this year on the state's rail system and the fourth on the Main Line, said Janet Hines, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit. Most of those deaths, she said, were classified as suicides.

Warren E. Buffett has bought more stock in Salomon Inc. and now controls 19 percent of the company's voting power. But even a billionaire financier like Mr. Buffett can make mistakes when filing documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The purchase of an additional 5.5 million shares in Salomon was disclosed yesterday in two parts. The first filing, made electronically to the S.E.C. after the close of trading yesterday, disclosed less than half of the shares purchased. A revised filing came a few minutes later. The shares were bought by the National Indemnity Company, an insurance subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the holding company controlled by Mr. Buffett, who served as chairman and chief executive of Salomon during the period after it was shaken by a scandal in Treasury bond trading. He has stepped down from those posts, but remains on Salomon's board. A spokesman for Berkshire's law firm, Munger, Tolles & Olsen of Los Angeles, said the first S.E.C. filing consisted of a preliminary version of the required disclosure form and was submitted by mistake. The correct filing showed that Berkshire had bought the additional 5.5 million common shares from Feb. 3 through yesterday, including almost 3 million shares bought yesterday. It paid a total of $272.5 million for the shares, for an average price of $49.37 a share, and accounted for 47 percent of the volume in Salomon during the period. Before the purchases, Berkshire controlled 14.7 percent of the company's voting power. The purchases raised Berkshire's stake to 6 million common shares and 700,000 preferred shares, which can be converted into an additional 18.4 million common shares. Berkshire has received antitrust clearance to raise its stake in Salomon to as high as 24.9 percent. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Salomon's stock rose 50 cents, to $49.625, on volume of 3.5 million shares, most of it purchased by Berkshire. Shares of Berkshire fell $50, to $15,300. The purchases were disclosed after the end of trading. Berkshire originally became involved with Salomon in 1987, when it bought the preferred stock for $700 million as a friendly investor. Salomon was then facing a possible takeover attempt by Ronald O. Perelman, the head of Revlon Inc., and it agreed to pay an extraordinarily high dividend rate of 9 percent on the issue. It is convertible into common stock at $38 per share. Berkshire bought its first common stock in Salomon last November, buying 495,200 shares for more than $21 million.  COMPANY NEWS

The plot was audacious. An imprisoned crime boss known as the Snake ordered the killing of a former mob prosecutor who he thought had been disrespectful. It was the kind of Mafia hit that, according to the lore of La Cosa Nostra, is forbidden. But a pair of brothers who were hit men botched the job, prosecutors said in a sweeping indictment yesterday. The two did not kill the former prosecutor -- they killed his father, the indictment says. And that was the start of a mob saga with an escalating body count. It was 1987. The order to kill was made by Carmine Persico, the jailed boss of the Colombo family, according to prosecutors. They said he gave his instruction to Joel Cacace, seen by prosecutors as an ambitious mobster. The target was a former federal prosecutor, William I. Aronwald, prosecutors in Brooklyn said. But, in a mistake of near biblical proportions, the hit men found and tracked not William, the intended victim, but his father, George M. Aronwald, 78. They shot him to death in a laundry near his home in Queens, and after the botched assignment, Mr. Cacace had his hit men killed, prosecutors said. Then, they added, he had the hit men who had killed the hit men killed. Mr. Cacace, they said, is now the acting boss of the Colombo family. He was charged with a variety of crimes in a racketeering indictment yesterday -- including the murder of Mr. Aronwald and the killing of the two hit men who killed the first hit men. There is a subplot. Mr. Cacace eventually married the widow of one of the original hit men. Still later, she ended up with another husband who himself would be murdered, an off-duty police officer whose 1997 slaying has remained one of the city's most puzzling -- along with the killing of George Aronwald. Yesterday, Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner, said he hoped that because of arrests in the case, investigators would get information on the 1997 killing of the officer, Ralph C. Dols. One of the most tangled Mafia stories to be unveiled in a long time came with the announcement yesterday of the charges against Mr. Cacace and 12 other men, including murder allegations and a host of bread-and-butter mob crimes such as extortion and gambling. But it was the mistaken killing of Mr. Aronwald, with its haunting twists, that was at the center of the case. ''Murders are never forgotten,'' said Roslynn R. Mauskopf, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, as she stood with a knot of law enforcement officials who declared that they had cracked a case that had eluded them for 16 years. The prosecutors said that Mr. Persico had been angered by Mr. Aronwald, who was a top federal organized crime prosecutor in Manhattan. They supplied few details of the source of that ire but said they had two cooperating witnesses who were at the center of the events. Yesterday, Mr. Aronwald, now 62 and a prominent defense lawyer in White Plains, said he was perplexed that Mr. Persico, whom he did not personally prosecute, had apparently found him disrespectful. There had always been suspicions, he said, that the killing of his father involved people hunting for him. ''It's difficult under any circumstances,'' he said with his voice cracking a few minutes after he learned the specifics of the prosecutors' new charges. ''But it makes it more difficult when he was basically an innocent victim of something that was intended for me. That just makes it more painful.'' He said he could not figure out what had provoked Mr. Persico. Among only a handful of Colombo cases he handled, he said, was one against Mr. Persico's brother, Alphonse, who was known as Allie Boy. But that case, he said, ended with an acquittal. A lawyer for Mr. Cacace, Michael L. Macklowitz, said yesterday that he would not comment on the charges. In a filing yesterday, the federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said that Mr. Persico gave his assassination order to Mr. Cacace, a member of the crime family who was climbing its ranks. Mr. Cacace, they said, personally scouted Mr. Aronwald's father's law office in Manhattan. In addition to a small private law practice, the senior Mr. Aronwald also worked as an administrative law judge for the city, ruling on challenges to parking tickets. Trying yesterday to reconstruct how the mistake was made, the younger Mr. Aronwald said yesterday that his name, too, was listed at his father's law office. The prosecutors said that after scouting the law office, Mr. Cacace turned the job over to three men. Two were brothers who were in the Colombo family, Vincent and Eddie Carini. The third, the prosecutors said, is now one of their witnesses against Mr. Cacace. A second witness, the prosecutors said, told them that leaders of organized crime were angered about the Aronwald killing and ordered the Carini brothers killed. ''Cacace carried out those orders,'' the prosecutors said their witness told them. Though the prosecutors did not mention it, news accounts have disclosed that Mr. Cacace had an unusual tie to the brothers that made him a suspect, apart from their role in the Aronwald killing. Eddie, who was also known as Enrico, was married to Kim T. Kennaugh, who was then 28. After Mr. Carini's death, Mr. Cacace married her. After they separated, she married Officer Dols, who was killed a decade after the Carini brothers were murdered. For years, the police have been saying that they had noted Mr. Cacace's central role in that tangle of relationships and were investigating. Back in 1987, the prosecutors said yesterday, Mr. Cacace did not stop with the killing of the brothers. One of their witnesses, they said, told them that a Luchese family soldier, Carmine Variale, and a Bonanno family associate, Frank Santora , killed the brothers on instructions from Mr. Cacace. In the car on the way back from the brothers' funeral, the prosecutors said, Mr. Cacace, pointed out Mr. Variale to a man in the car with him. The two went off to get a gun to kill him, they said, but did not find him that day. Later, according to the prosecutors, in broad daylight outside a Bath Avenue social club in Brooklyn on Sept. 23, 1987, the man who had been in the car that day killed Mr. Variale and Mr. Santora. Now, they said, he is one of the witnesses against Mr. Cacace.

LEAD: A judge who resigned after developing what he called stage fright has won a lifetime disability pension at the age of 44. A judge who resigned after developing what he called stage fright has won a lifetime disability pension at the age of 44. Former Municipal Judge Joseph K. Davis received the pension, $56,002 a year, to settle a dispute with a California state agency over the severity of psychiatric problems he had after nine years on the bench. He resigned a year ago on the final day of a six-year term. He had actually stopped working more than a year earlier, when he filed for a disability pension. In a lawsuit filed last summer, Judge Davis said he developed ''stage fright'' about a year after taking the bench. Taking Pills to Get Through The problem, complicated by ''depression with anxiety,'' interfered with his ability to perform routine judicial tasks and forced him to take ''inordinate'' amounts of tranquilizers to get through the job, he said. Despite efforts to hide the problem, he said, it worsened to the point that he panicked in any public setting where he was expected to speak. The former judge has no telephone listing in San Diego. His lawyer, John Mitchell, said he would not discuss the case. Judge Davis sued after the state Commission on Judicial Performance denied him a disability pension. In Superior Court in September, Judge Kevin Midlam ruled that the commission had acted arbitrarily and that none of the four doctors who had examined Judge Davis had disputed his claim that he could no longer do his job. Working Out a Pact Two months later, the commission chose to settle rather than appeal. Judge Midlam approved the settlement. Jack Frankel, director and chief counsel of the Commission on Judicial Performance, said the commission had contested the pension claim because it was felt that all avenues of treatment had not been exhausted. State law provides for lifetime pensions of 65 percent of salary for any ex-judges who can no longer do the job because of a mental or physical disability that is permanent or likely to become so. The pension is tied to the salaries of active Municipal Court judges, so Mr. Davis's pension could increase.
LEAD: To the Editor: To the Editor: Your report on worries by education officials and others that the heavy burden of college debt is threatening the financial stability of a generation of young people and their families (Jan. 29) was a good one, but the solution is obvious. Student debts should be repaid by a surtax on income. Each $1,000 borrowed would increase the tax rate by an actuarially determined amount, and payment could be spread over a lifetime. Those who earn more money would pay more, but with all borrowers in the pool and a lifetime repayment span, actual payments would be relatively low. Each year, the Department of Education could inform borrowers of their surtax rate, and, as with the Form 1099, send a copy to the Internal Revenue Service. Not only would this eliminate the burden of student debt, but it might in addition actually serve as a counterweight to the deplorable fact that, in our economic system, remuneration is generally in inverse proportion to the social value of work being performed. WILLIAM A. BAKER New York, Jan. 29, 1987
LEAD: In 1888 the National Geographic Society published the first issue of its magazine, a plain-brown-wrapper affair with no pictures and few readers. Its mandate was to promote ''the increase and diffusion of geographical knowledge.'' In 1888 the National Geographic Society published the first issue of its magazine, a plain-brown-wrapper affair with no pictures and few readers. Its mandate was to promote ''the increase and diffusion of geographical knowledge.'' But if the society has resolutely pursued that mission in the past century, the only thing plain brown wrapper about the organization today is the sleeve it uses to protect one of the most widely read magazines in the world. With a 1987 budget of $419 million and 2,500 employees, the National Geographic Society bills itself as the world's largest nonprofit scientific and educational organization. In addition to publishing a magazine sent to 10.5 million members, it sponsors research worldwide and produces TV documentaries watched by 30 million people a month. Now the society has begun to broaden itself further. It is aggressively marketing home video cassettes and considering the production of G-rated films for an audience that has found the documentaries attractive family fare. There is room for growth: television still accounts for less than 5 percent of the society's revenue, with about $19 million in gross receipts, said Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president and chairman of the society. And this year, after more than two decades in the business, executives at the society expect the television effort finally to break even. The Society's Evolution Until 1965, the magazine and a related book service were the primary disseminators of information about the society's activities, a wild mix of the mundane-made-extraordinary (''The World in Your Garden'') and such Indiana Jones-style expeditions as the excavation of Machu Picchu in Peru. Then the society saw the future, and it was television. ''Americans on Everest,'' the first ''National Geographic Special,'' was aired in September of that year. A decade later, the specials found a permanent home on the Public Broadcasting System. In 1985 the society began producing a weekly two-hour series, ''National Geographic Explorer,'' for Ted Turner's cable network. A year later, the society entered into an arrangement with Vestron Inc. to market ''Special'' and ''Explorer'' video cassettes. That move, executives of the society hope, will wipe out within four years the deficit of $13 million to $15 million that the television operations have accrued since the first special. The overall television budget is $25 million. ''Explorer'' gets $13 million, the specials and home videos get $4.5 million each and syndication receives $3 million, said Tim Kelly, associate director for television and executive producer of ''Explorer.'' Toying With Film Making Dennis B. Kane, vice president and director of television for the society, also wants to get into the film business. ''We enjoy the relationship with PBS,'' Mr. Kane said, ''but we had to branch out and get into a commercial situation. ''We're looking into the possibility of G-rated features,'' he added. ''There is a need for good G-rated nonfiction films.'' The society's handling of an upcoming program suggests how aggressive the video cassette marketing effort is. Vestron will have a head start in selling ''The Explorers: A Century of Discovery,'' a $900,000 centenary special to be aired in October on PBS. ''The Explorers'' will go into the Vestron catalogue a month earlier, at the $29.98 price of other society cassettes. That strategy was first employed when ''Secrets of the Titanic'' was released in December 1986; it went on to become the biggest seller in the catalogue. In just over two years, about one million National Geographic Society cassettes have been sold, said Al Reuben, senior vice president for marketing, sales and distribution at Vestron. Half of the sales are through video outlets and half through nontraditional markets - bookstores, mass merchandisers and museum shops -and through people who order directly from Vestron, Mr. Reuben said. Shows Among Highest-Rated Nineteen of public television's 25 highest-rated broadcasts have been National Geographic Specials, and the highest was also the first: ''The Incredible Machine,'' a fantastic voyage through the human body. ''They're probably the single most watched group of programs we air,'' said John Fuller, director of research for the Public Broadcasting System. The four ''National Geographic Special'' programs that the society coproduces each year with WQED, a Pittsburgh PBS affiliate, cost $600,000 to $650,000 apiece to make. They are underwritten by the Chevron Corporation and can be in the works for as long as three years. The ''Explorer'' shows cost $160,000 each to produce. The series, Mr. Kelly said, has benefited from developments in the television industry, from the advent of cable to growing audiences for family programming. Ratings Down on PBS The society is about to extend its contract with Turner for three more years. But the picture has not been so bright this year at PBS. The four ''National Geographic Special'' programs, which aired in the first four months of the year, averaged a 6.1 rating (the percentage of households with televisions), which translated to 5.4 million households. Last year's average rating was 9.4. ''This was not a stellar season for National Geographic,'' Mr. Fuller, of PBS, said. ''They've spread their distribution beyond PBS, and it's hard to know if that has had an effect. This year was one of the lowest.'' Possibly, he added, viewers were not interested in ''Inside the Soviet Circus'' or ''Mysteries of Mankind,'' the shows with the lowest ratings. ''It's hard to know whether it's a trend or just this year,'' he said. No Doubts on Television In the centenary of what for him is a family business, Mr. Grosvenor is not worrying. He is a great-great-grandson of the society's second president, Alexander Graham Bell, and he does not mind running a deficit or chancing a few ratings points in the service of the society's educational mission. Mr. Grosvenor reaches as many people through television as he does through the magazine; he has no doubt that the move into television was right. ''One of the wonderful things about this place is that I don't have to show a black line if we perceive the program to be educational,''  THE MEDIA BUSINESS
A. RICHARD GOLUB, the flamboyant Manhattan lawyer of celebrities, has been vindicated by the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court, which on Thursday set aside a judgment against him that was based on allegations that he had had a sexual relationship with a client. WARREN EDWARDS, the shoe manufacturer, had sued Mr. Golub, asserting that the lawyer, who had represented his former wife, ELISABETH ANN EDWARDS in the couple's divorce proceedings, should be removed from the case and penalized. Mr. Golub did withdraw, but never acknowledged the relationship. The appeals court said in its decision, "There is no authority in this state which would require withdrawal in the circumstances presented." A lower-court decision in Mr. Edwards's favor on May 9, 1990, had set damages at $10,000.

Iraqi electoral officials on Sunday scheduled national and provincial elections for Jan. 30 and said that nearly 200 political groups had applied to take part. But with violence endemic, voter registration was hampered in the west and north, Iraqi and United Nations officials said. About 90 of more than 540 registration centers have been shut down because of violence or threats, said Carlos Valenzuela, the head of the United Nations electoral advisory team. The shuttered centers include all of those in Anbar Province, which includes the hostile cities of Falluja and Ramadi, and those in Ninevah Province, whose capital is Mosul, the country's third largest city and a strong base for the insurgency. The two provinces are dominated by Sunni Arabs. American and Iraqi officials say a high Sunni voter turnout that leads to Sunni acceptance of the new government is the best hope for quelling the insurgency. A failure to properly register voters in Anbar and Ninevah could cast doubt on the outcome of the elections and worsen the guerrilla war. The Sunni Arabs make up one-fifth of the population of Iraq and ruled the region for centuries until the American invasion toppled Saddam Hussein, a Sunni. Mr. Hussein persecuted Kurds and Shiite Arabs. The Americans hope the elections will install legitimate majority rule by the Shiites, who make up at least 60 percent of the population, though many Sunnis remain resistant to the idea. Electoral officials are now scrambling to find ways to ensure proper voter registration in Anbar and Ninevah without having to risk opening registration centers. ''There have been problems, but that was to be expected,'' Mr. Valenzuela said. On Sunday, Jan. 30, Iraqis will vote for members of a 275-seat national assembly, which will then appoint a prime minister and other executives from its membership. The assembly is responsible for drafting a permanent constitution, and elections for a full-term government are planned for the end of 2005. Iraqis will also vote on Jan. 30 for provincial leaders. The northern Kurdish region will have a third election, for a Kurdistan Assembly. Mr. Valenzuela said voter registration sheets were distributed to the 24 registration centers in Anbar, but the centers shut down before the American troops swept into Falluja on Nov. 8. The electoral commission decided to close the 56 registration centers in Ninevah after insurgents sparked an uprising in Mosul on Nov. 11 and overran half a dozen police stations, spurring 3,200 of the city's 4,000 police officers to abandon their jobs. Nine other registration centers around the country have been closed because of potential violence. Two or three were in Baquba, 35 miles northeast of the capital, where guerrillas attacked police stations and American military convoys last week. Only one center, in Baghdad, has actually been attacked, Mr. Valenzuela said. A bomb exploded outside the building recently, but no one was injured. The center remains open. Officials are looking at alternative registration options where centers have been closed, Mr. Valenzuela said. Abdul-Hussein Hindawi, the head of the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, said one option was to let Iraqis register the day of the elections at the polling stations. As of Sunday, 198 parties had applied to participate in the elections, 44 of them with just a single person. The commission had approved 126. More than 15 parties were Sunni-dominated, Mr. Hindawi said. THE CONFLICT IN IRAQ: VOTING
A new company, backed by the Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation and other investors, will introduce on Tuesday a service that lets video-game devotees play the most popular Sega and Nintendo games over local telephone lines. Under the system, a user in one home would be able to square off with another player in the same city for games like Mortal Kombat and N.B.A. Jam. The company, Catapult Entertainment Inc., was founded earlier this year by former executives of Sony Pictures, General Magic and Apple Computer. It plans to begin offering the service in some cities before Christmas. Renewing Interest Adam Grosser, the president of Catapult, noted that the most popular games run on the current generation of 16-bit machines and have millions of users each. The phone service is seen as a way of raising interest in a maturing technology until the arrival of 32-bit games in 1995. "It's a really interesting way to introduce new life into old 16-bit technology," said Denise Caruso, editorial director of Technology & Media, a computer industry newsletter in San Francisco. "There's market demand for interesting ways to play games." In the rush to new interactive media, multiplayer games are seen as one of the most promising avenues for digital cable services and personal computer networks. The Catapult service is based on a low-speed modem that is inserted between the game machine and the video game cartridge. Mr. Grosser said Catapult, based in Cupertino, Calif., expected to generate its revenue primarily from the service part of its business, not the sale of the modem cartridge, which will probably be priced at $50 to $60. Another start-up company, P. F. Magic, has received backing from the AT&T Corporation and others for a modem cartridge called the Edge, which would also allow games to be played over phone lines. But the company has not announced plans to support existing video games or a service for finding partners. Users of the Catapult system will pay $5 to $10 a month for the service, depending on usage. To play a game, a user will dial a centralized computer, which will match the player against another player in his or her local area. The computer will automatically dial the other person. "We're really a dating service," Mr. Grosser said. "The reason kids play games is for the challenge and the competition. We think we've satisfied that need." The company would not disclose its initial investment in the service, but Mr. Grosser said that it would be able to support its activities for several years. Catapult's investors also include Davis Video Enterprises, founded by John and Marvin Davis. Blockbuster Entertainment has been looking at the video game market as a new growth area. Last week, Newleaf Entertainment and Sega of America said that they would test-market a new electronic delivery system for video games in several Blockbuster Video stores this summer. The new Catapult service has a potential obstacle: Parents may be concerned that the games could dominate their home's only telephone line.  But Mr. Grosser noted that if the line had a "call waiting" feature, the system would be automatically alerted to incoming calls. If the player wanted to answer the call, the game would disconnect. Players will not be able to speak to each other over the phone line, but they can send each other a variety of pre-programmed electronic messages. "This takes a solitary activity and socializes it," Mr. Grosser said. The Catapult system works by synchronizing the two video games and than capturing information from the video game controllers in each home. Initially, the system will support the 10 most popular games offered by Sega and Nintendo. Catapult plans to start the service in November in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, and later in Dallas and Atlanta. The company plans tournaments to generate interest. While the service will be offered 24 hours a day, the company expects the peak hours to be 3 to 11 P.M. During those hours, Catapult plans to be able to match players within one minute of an inquiry.  THE MEDIA BUSINESS

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's charter revision commission, which has not yet been impaneled, is already poised to break a record: it is set to spend less time studying a major change in city government than any other such commission in memory. The mayor plans to name the members of the commission as early as today to study his proposals to move to nonpartisan elections in New York City and to change the lines of mayoral succession. Since Mr. Bloomberg has said that he wants to put the proposals before the voters in November, city law gives the commission only until Sept. 6 to hold hearings and come up with its proposals. That gives the commission eight weeks. In an interesting twist, officials said, one of the people who has agreed to serve on the panel to study ways to abolish party primaries in the city is the man Mr. Bloomberg beat in the Republican mayoral primary last year: Herman Badillo. Mr. Bloomberg's predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was often criticized for hastily forming charter revision commissions and giving them only a summer to come up with proposals. But Mr. Giuliani never formed a commission later than June 15. Now members of several civic organizations and advocacy groups are questioning whether it would be proper for Mayor Bloomberg's commission to come up with proposals in an eight-week period over the summer, when many city residents and interested parties are away on vacations. Several said in interviews that they were open to the mayor's proposals, but thought that the ideas merited much longer study. Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., the chairman of the city's 1989 charter revision commission, said in an interview that he thought that eight weeks was too little time. ''Based on my experience, it wouldn't either be possible or proper to do the job on the issues that the mayor has asked this putative commission to consider in so little time,'' he said. The mayor's communications director, William Cunningham, said that the issue of nonpartisan elections had been studied by past charter revision committees. ''These are not new issues, and that to me is not a germane argument,'' he said. The issue is not without controversy. Although most big cities have moved to nonpartisan elections, the proposal by Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, is seen by some as an attempt to help Republicans in a city where registered Democrats outnumber them by more than 5 to 1. Several top city Democrats oppose the plan, including City Council Speaker Gifford Miller and Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. Betsy Gotbaum, the public advocate, opposes Mr. Bloomberg's goal of removing her office from the line of succession and says she believes the public should get more time to study the issue. The mayor wants a deputy mayor to be next in line. Several veterans of previous battles over revising the City Charter, which is more or less its constitution, said that they had trouble believing the mayor still intended to put the questions on the ballot in November. ''If they are going on the ballot this year, it is a joke,'' said Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer at the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''It would be worthy of a banana republic, not New York City.'' Robert McGuire, a former police commissioner who said that he had agreed to serve on the commission, said that the group would be mindful of concerns over timing. ''That's the issue that we have to resolve,'' he said, ''to see if we have enough time and the ability to reach out to all the constituencies in the city, to get their full involvement and full input.''
LEAD: Intensified attacks by guerrilla forces in and near Kabul are intended to bring about the collapse of the Soviet-backed Government by sapping the morale of the Afghan Army and undermining confidence in the regime, Western and Asian diplomats and knowledgeable Afghans said today. Intensified attacks by guerrilla forces in and near Kabul are intended to bring about the collapse of the Soviet-backed Government by sapping the morale of the Afghan Army and undermining confidence in the regime, Western and Asian diplomats and knowledgeable Afghans said today. A rocket attack Saturday on Kabul's international airport, in which four people were reported killed, and rocket and mortar exchanges within 10 miles of the capital are viewed as part of a developing guerrilla strategy to coincide with the departure of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. ''The mujahedeen cannot win militarily; they simply do not have the firepower in comparison to Government forces,'' one knowledgeable European diplomat said today, referring to the Islamic guerrillas. ''Their strategy is to insure that the regime loses its self-confidence and will to survive and eventually folds up its tents.'' Another Western diplomat said: ''By coming so close to Kabul, which is the prize, the mujahedeen are unhinging the armed forces and setting the stage for disintegration of the Government. That's the first step: exposing the vulnerability of the very people who are supposed to defend the Afghans once the Russians leave.'' Two Provincial Capitals Lost A European diplomat said: ''The mujahedeen are sending a message that says, 'You cannot catch us; you cannot protect your own people.' It is a message directly aimed at the military.'' Adding to the sense of unease in Kabul is the recent loss of two provincial capitals, Taloqan in northern Takhar Province and Bamyan in Bamyan Province in central Afghanistan. Since the Government has vowed that no capital of any of the nation's 29 provinces would fall, the losses are seen as embarrassing. An Asian diplomat said, ''The mujahedeen objective is to capture Kabul largely through military defections that would have the effect of demoralizing the Government and the people and lead to a takeover.'' With the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet troops half completed and the rest scheduled to leave by Feb. 15 under the Geneva accords signed last April, the defense of the Kabul Government increasingly rests with the Afghan armed forces, numbering about 140,000. There are believed to be about 1,500 defections a month from the Afghan armed forces and militia. Quality of Military Varies The quality of the Afghan military varies considerably, with high marks given to the state security forces. Moreover, some military experts say the Afghan forces have improved considerably since 1984. But once the Soviet troops depart, the question remains pointed about the ability of the Afghan Army to resist the guerrillas. A Government official, Deputy Minister of Repatriation Abdul Khalil Jalal, said today that guerrilla rocket attacks - which reportedly have killed at least 100 civilians in Kabul in recent months - actually marked a sharp setback for the guerrillas. ''People now recognize the real face of the opposition,'' Mr. Jalal said. ''They kill innocent people with rockets, poor people, children. People know the true face of the enemy now.'' ''This does not fit with the ideas of Islam, killing innocent people,'' he added. ''The Afghan people know their enemy.'' Soviet Union Is Mistrusted Several diplomats as well as Afghans said there was a widespread view among the populace that the Russians were lobbing rockets on Kabul in an attempt to place blame on the guerrillas. Western diplomats scoff at the notion, but it underscores the mistrust of the Soviet Union felt by many Afghans. By all accounts, the Government of President Najibullah, the head of the Soviet-supported People's Democratic Party, remains reasonably entrenched until the Soviet withdrawal. Despite some evidence that Soviet relations with the 41-year-old Afghan leader are strained, the Russians are said to be likely to support him long enough to allow a transition to a more popular, perhaps nonaligned, regime still close to Moscow. The politician most prominently mentioned as Mr. Najibullah's potential successor is Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoi, the Minister of Interior. Guerrilla Splits Cited Moscow as well as Kabul officials are counting on divisions among the fractious seven-party guerrilla front to restrain them from controlling the Afghan Government once the Soviet troops depart. Although some Afghans believe President Najibullah will survive politically, most say he will ultimately lose his post. In the last year, Mr. Najibullah has sought a policy of ''national reconciliation'' to lure the opposition into his Government, but this has been rejected by the guerrillas. The President, for example, has reportedly offered the post of Defense Minister to a powerful guerrilla leader in the northern provinces, Ahmad Shah Massoud. But Mr. Massoud has rejected the proposal. Afghan officials and diplomats say privately that the Afghans may ultimately have the type of regime that they have traditonally accepted: a weak central government with powerful regional and tribal leaders. ''The best thing a viable Afghanistan could look forward to, with a weak central government, would be an Asian Yugoslavia,'' a Western diplomat said.

LEAD: As democracy was being mugged in Panama, it was showing surprising resilience this week in Bolivia, a country once synonymous with instability.

Strikingly, the front-runners are Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the architect of a tough economic stabilization plan, and former President Hugo Banzer, who endorses it. As democracy was being mugged in Panama, it was showing surprising resilience this week in Bolivia, a country once synonymous with instability. An orderly presidential vote produced no majority winner, so the final selection will again be made by the congress when it convenes in August. Strikingly, the front-runners are Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the architect of a tough economic stabilization plan, and former President Hugo Banzer, who endorses it. Running third is the left-of-center Jaime Paz Zamora, who accepts the need for spending restraint, though he cavils at specific programs. A fairly fought campaign and the prospect of a second constitutional transition represent real achievements in a country where governments rarely lasted more than a year. A deeper source of stability has been the land reform program of the 1950's. Giving peasants title has helped immunize Bolivia from insurgencies bleeding its neighbors. Most Bolivians now appear to approve an austerity program that has slashed subsidies, simplified taxes, cut budget deficits and tamed an inflation rate that soared to 24,000 percent in 1985. But there's a catch. Bolivia's stability is hostage to Argentina's financial chaos and the good sense of foreign creditors. There's a way Washington can help. The austerity program is Bolivia's half of an innovative bargain to reduce a crushing foreign debt. The Europeans did their share by providing funds for Bolivia to buy back at 11 cents on the dollar some $600 million in principal owed to commercial banks. This gave Bolivia breathing space as President Victor Paz Estenssoro braked a cycle of boom and stagnation, productive mainly of military dictators. And now stability is threatened from an unexpected quarter: Argentina. Racked by hyperinflation, and on the eve of a contentious election, Argentina has ceased paying Bolivia for natural gas. Argentina owes $200 million - a large chunk of Bolivia's total income. This comes in the midst of Bolivia's loan renegotiations, with some banks squeezing so hard as to endanger this recuperating patient. Bolivian officials are heading to Washington in search of a bridge loan of $100 million. This would be repayable in August after Bolivia seats a new President and would cover the shortfall from Argentina. For the Bush Administration not to help would cruelly reward a country coping maturely with crushing problems in a democratic way.

A Brooklyn florist has been arrested with over 600,000 tablets of the drug Ecstasy in what federal agents and the police said yesterday was the New York area's largest single seizure of the popular drug sold in dance clubs and at all-night raves. The man, identified as Charles Coppola, 58, was arrested Thursday morning in front of his home at 2714 East 65th Street in the Mill Basin section of Brooklyn by agents from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and the city and state police, the authorities said. Yesterday, Mr. Coppola was arraigned in Federal District Court in Brooklyn before Magistrate Judge Marilyn Dolan Go on a single count of possession with intent to distribute narcotics and was held without bail. At the arraignment, Jed Davis, an assistant United States attorney, said Mr. Coppola faced up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Mr. Coppola's lawyer, Fern Schwaber, would not comment on the case. A euphoria-producing synthetic stimulant, Ecstasy, which is also known as MDMA for the chemical compound that makes up its active ingredient -- methylenedioxymethamphetamine -- has become increasingly popular in recent years, officials said. Lewis Rice Jr., the special agent in charge of the D.E.A.'s New York office, yesterday pointed to a study released Monday by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America that found use among American teenagers had doubled since 1995. He said the rise in the drug's popularity was being driven in part by traffickers who have carefully marketed the drug, a commodity from which they are making millions of dollars. The drug is largely produced in Western Europe, often in the Netherlands, where it can be bought for 50 cents to $2 per tablet, he said. It is sold in New York and around the country for $20 to $40 per tablet, making a conservative estimate of the potential profit on the drugs seized from Mr. Coppola of more than $10 million. The seizure is the second-largest in the United States, said Joseph Pentangelo, a D.E.A. spokesman. The largest, involving more than 2 million tablets, was made by U.S. Customs Service agents in July. Some of the pills seized Thursday were found in the trunk of Mr. Coppola's rental car and others were found in his house, according to a criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn by Frank Adamo, a D.E.A. special agent. The complaint also said that the New York Drug Enforcement Task Force, made up of D.E.A. agents and New York City and state police investigators, had been investigating Mr. Coppola since January. The Ecstasy tablets seized in the case are emblazoned with different logos, including four-leaf clovers and a silhouette of the cartoon character Tweety Bird, Mr. Rice said. A law enforcement official said  Mr. Coppola was a ''low-level player'' with one prior arrest for tax violations in 1992. During the arraignment, Mr. Davis, the assistant United States attorney, said Mr. Coppola has made several trips to Israel despite claiming a weekly income of just a few hundred dollars a week.
Three years ago Carlos Knight was living in a Williamsburg homeless shelter and surviving on $599 a month in Supplemental Security Income. He was unable to hold a permanent job, he said, because of bipolar disorder, which causes him to feel elated one minute and utterly depressed the next. ''I get a lot of mood swings,'' he said. ''When I get depressed I get frustrated, and I can't think, and I can't make a decision.'' Mr. Knight, now 35, was referred to the East New York Clubhouse by a worker at the shelter where he slept. ''They said you need something to occupy your time all day,'' Mr. Knight said. The clubhouse offers a daytime program for mentally ill adults. It is run by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The clubhouse has 130 members. To qualify, one needs only have an interest in coming and have a diagnosed mental illness or disability. Each member is referred by a social worker or a mental health therapist. About 45 members come each day to the clubhouse, several inviting rooms on the ground floor of a brick building on Atlantic Avenue between Vermont and Wyona Streets. ''The goal of the clubhouse is to foster independence through a variety of tasks,'' said the clubhouse's director, Beth Schultz. Members, most of whom have depression or other mental disabilities like schizophrenia or developmental retardation, cook breakfast and lunch for one another, make sure the clubhouse is kept clean, learn computer programs, answer the clubhouse's phones, and form discussion committees. Among these are the problem resolution committee, which aims at resolving conflicts that may arise between members, and the men's committee, in which male clubhouse members talk about the stresses of relationships. Each day members sign up for a variety of tasks listed on a large black chalkboard near the dining area, such as: ''Sweep in front of building,'' ''Water plants,'' ''Empty garbage,'' ''Clean off stove,'' ''Mop kitchen'' and ''Re-stock bathrooms.'' The jobs provide basic skills for the members who need them, Ms. Schultz said, but for the members with depression they can serve another, perhaps more important purpose. ''It takes our minds off all that stuff that we struggle with,'' she said. ''Some of the members said when they're busy in the kitchen they don't think about their mental illness.'' Before Renee Pierce, 44, came to the clubhouse a year ago, she was unemployed and sleeping on a couch in her mother's Brooklyn apartment. When she first came to the clubhouse, Ms. Pierce, who is mildly mentally retarded and schizophrenic, was shy and inactive. She has become a great help to the clubhouse's staff, acting as a receptionist and messenger, Ms. Schultz said. Ms. Pierce is studying for her G.E.D., and plans on getting it within two years. She said she hoped to become a home health aide or a nurse's assistant. As Ms. Pierce sat across the room, laughing and joking with other clubhouse members, Ms. Schultz looked at her and said, ''This is someone who was pretty much more withdrawn. For her to realize that she can be accepted is pretty powerful.'' Mr. Knight said he found a reason to believe in himself at the clubhouse. He recently was hired by the New York Foundling Hospital to help build custom-made wheelchairs for disabled children. ''You come here and you try to build yourself,'' he said. ''Where else can you come to make friends and build up your skills?'' HOW TO HELP Checks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to P.O.

To the Editor: You fault President Bush for the nuclear treaty he signed with India, citing the damage it does to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. But considering that Iran and North Korea signed that treaty (North Korea later withdrew), it would seem clear that the treaty has been a failure. Instead of pretending that the treaty works, Mr. Bush rightly acknowledges that a liberal democracy like India is entitled to a nuclear program as much as we are. Also, I am surprised that instead of admiring Mr. Bush for his plain talk with Gen. Pervez Musharraf in pushing for democracy in Pakistan and denying his country similar terms, you criticize him for insulting General Musharraf. Ari Weitzner  New York, March 7, 2006
LEAD: A 5-year-old Bronx boy was killed yesterday afternoon at a gathering of family and friends, the victim of what seemed to be a random shot fired from across the street, the police said. A 5-year-old Bronx boy was killed yesterday afternoon at a gathering of family and friends, the victim of what seemed to be a random shot fired from across the street, the police said. The killing came just over three hours after an 11-year-old girl was wounded, also by a stray bullet, in another part of the South Bronx. The police said there was no connection between the two incidents. A police spokesman, Sgt. Maurice Howard, said the second shooting occurred at 1:15 P.M. in a housing project in the Clasons Point section. He said the victim, Jose Diaz, lived in a fourth-floor apartment at 1755 Story Avenue and was celebrating Christmas with his mother, Anna Diaz, 32, and several other adults and children at the time. Suddenly, the sergeant reported, a bullet ripped through a metal window frame into the living room, struck the boy in the head, and lodged in a closet wall. He said the boy was pronounced dead shortly after 2:30 at Bronx Municipal Hospital Center as detectives began their investigation into the circumstances of the shooting and where the shot had come from. Last evening, it remained unclear who and how many people were at the gathering because those present left the apartment as quickly as they could, Sergeant Howard said. Earlier, at 10:07 A.M. across the Bronx River, the 11-year-old was leaving a grocery store at 1142 East 165th Street when she was shot. ''She heard a pop and felt the pain in her leg,'' the sergeant said. The girl, whose name was withheld, was taken to Lincoln Hospital with a wound in her left calf but otherwise in good condition, Sergeant Howard said. According to investigators, .22-caliber shells were found on a roof in the vicinity, indicating a less powerful firearm than the one with which the Diaz boy was slain.
Will the new era be dominated by regional alliances and economic pacts or by a renewal of global and multilateral institutions? The 1990's are shaping up as a struggle between these rival international orders. So far, regional relationships -- in Europe, North America and elsewhere -- have the upper hand. The emerging world order looks like an old house: new rooms, windows and doors have been added, but the foundation, plumbing and wiring remain in dangerous disrepair. There is a need to make regional economic experiments complement, not compete, with multilateralism. This requires agreement among the major nations about a blueprint of a new world order. Most creative foreign policy in recent years has been directed at regional economic integration, particularly in Europe, North America and Asia. These efforts need not compete with the larger global order. Most studies of European and North American integration conclude that it will create more trade than it diverts. Nor are regional agreements necessarily incompatible with the global regime of GATT: Pulling down internal walls without raising external ones is good for the world economy. The real danger of regionalism lies elsewhere. Regionalism is difficult to shield from domestic and trans-national political pressures and disputes. The European Community's hard line against Japanese imports suggests how regionalism deepens fault lines. European and North American regionalism also diverts attention from GATT and other multilateral institutions. The "promise" of European unity and the North American free-trade agreement has reduced the political costs should the current round of multilateral trade negotiations fail. In this real sense, regional and global institutions compete. The task is to fold regional experiments into global institutional reform. Key will be the relationship among the industrial democracies -- the Group of Seven. Some suggest a Group of Seven declaration on the limits and responsibilities of "good regionalism." This would ease fears in Asia and elsewhere about the ultimate aims of recent regional agreements. It would also push the Group of Seven countries to use their next summit to discuss the basic structure of world order. Helmut Kohl and John Major are not Bismarck and Palmerston, and President-elect Bill Clinton certainly has none of the pretensions of Woodrow Wilson, but these leaders must be strongly encouraged to be global architects. The Group of Seven should also focus on its own inadequate process. The annual summit meetings of heads of state are overly formal, scripted events that produce little more than bland official communiques. Experts -- nicknamed "sherpas" -- do the real work in the months leading up to the meetings. Coordination must be strengthened by turning the summits into informal discussions, while formalizing meetings of ministers and experts. Global institutional reform must also extend to traditional multilateral organizations -- the United Nations, International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Without a new mission, they look increasingly like relics. Security Council seats for Japan and Germany are inevitable. Negotiations over this issue should be broadened into an effort to make the U.N. more relevant in international disputes. The 50th anniversary of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in 1994 and of the U.N. in 1995 will be moments of symbolic opportunity. American officials need to articulate a vision of how these global institutions serve our interests and strategy for shaping the emerging order. Recession and election-year politics have inevitably obscured the big issues of foreign policy. After World War II, Americans were more worried about the economy than in building a new international order. Stalin provided the jolt to the West for united action. Today there is no such stimulus. Leadership and vision will have to make the difference if we are to put our global house in order. G. John Ikenberry, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is author of the forthcoming book, "Moments of Creation: The Rebuilding of International Order, 1815, 1919, 1945 and 1990."

But the vendors do not give "paid" invoices and avoid taxes! We purchased a sketch because we liked it, not knowing it was created by a "master." Only recently, in a library, did we discover a copy of the sketch in an art book. Missing since 1926 (sketched in 1893), the piece cannot be insured, appraised or perhaps even sold. We must show legal possession, and we found out this is no easy matter. It is now in storage. JACK A. GASNICK New York
For months, local residents say, the group of 15 Arab and Central Asian fighters lived quietly in a two-story house here, among the hundreds of guerrillas who had turned this wooded vale near the Russian border into a burgeoning center of Islamic militancy. Like many of those who gathered here, the fighters had come over the snowy passes from Chechnya, where they had been helping their fellow Muslims in their struggle to break with the Russian republic. They exercised to stay in shape and went into the woods to practice shooting. Some of the militants departed, presumably for Russia, while new ones came to prepare for the fight. Then, one night last fall, according to local residents, the group of Arabs and Central Asians packed up and left. Over the next several months, villagers and Georgian officials said, hundreds of other fighters followed, never to return. ''One morning, I got up, and they were gone,'' said Valodya Tskhovrebov, a farmer who lived near the Arab fighters. ''They were nice guys. They didn't drink or smoke.'' The departure of the Islamic fighters from this gorge in the Caucasus Mountains appears to represent an uncertain victory for the Bush administration, which last year asserted that the area had become a center of activity by Al Qaeda. To help Georgia confront the threat, the administration dispatched a team of Green Berets last year to provide military training to the country's troops. Since last August, when Georgian forces began an operation to clear the gorge, senior Georgian leaders and Western diplomats here say the number of guerrillas in the gorge has dropped to fewer than 50 from about 700. The passage of militants across the mountains into Chechnya has largely ceased for the moment, according to Western diplomats and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has dispatched observers to watch the border. Georgian officials say they detained more than 30 militants from the gorge, most of them Arabs or Chechens. They were deported, the officials said, to countries ranging from Russia to France and Japan, where officials say they detained a Japanese citizen helping the guerrillas. A senior Georgian official said his government had also turned over 13 Arab fighters to the United States government last fall. The Arabs had been found in the gorge and were suspected of being involved in the Chechen campaign. It is unclear what the Americans did with them. ''We just handed them over,'' the Georgian official said. Officials at the American Embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, declined to comment on the reported deportations. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, the Bush administration has taken into custody hundreds of foreign citizens suspected of terrorism and held them without charges or access to legal representation. The administration has refused to release the names of those arrested, considering them enemy combatants. What happened to the hundreds of other fighters who left the Pankisi Gorge remains a mystery that casts doubt on the ultimate success of the operation to sweep the area of Islamic militants. Villagers said that most of the fighters were Chechen, and that once it became clear they were no longer welcome in Georgia, they headed back toward Russia. Some of the fighters, they said, were killed by Russian soldiers as they crossed the mountains. Indeed, the American-backed effort to clear the gorge of terrorists appears to have become a de facto campaign against the Chechen nationalist movement as well, thereby entangling the United States in the region's politics to a greater extent than before. By most accounts here, the overwhelming majority of the fighters in the gorge were Chechens, and while they were intensely religious, they were dedicated to striking at Russian, not Western, targets. For months, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had threatened to send his country's forces into Georgia against the Chechen rebels he said were taking shelter in the Pankisi Gorge. Georgian officials, fearing a Russian attack, turned to the United States for help last year. Georgian officials say Mr. Putin was furious over their decision to invite American military trainers into a country that he regards as falling within Russia's sphere of influence. But for now, the threat of invasion seems to have ebbed. Yet while the operation appears to have succeeded in apprehending several individuals with possible links to Al Qaeda, it also appears to have killed many Chechen guerrillas, and thereby to have embittered Chechens who looked to the United States for sympathy in what they considered a legitimate revolt against a repressive government. One Chechen refugee, Acima Imadiova, who lives in a dilapidated community center in the gorge, approached an American visitor, wearing a bitter smile. ''Tell Mr. Bush to stop the war in Chechnya,'' she said. ''Ask him why he is paddling in the same boat with Putin.'' The first Chechen guerrillas began arriving here in 1999, as the second Chechen war got under way. The gorge, a lush river valley about 25 miles from the Russian border, was already home to several thousand ethnic Chechens known as the Kist, whose ancestors had migrated to predominantly Christian Georgia a century ago. By all appearances, the gorge was a perfect sanctuary for the fighters to rest and regroup. Grozny was but two days away by foot, through one of the innumerable passes that lead to Russia. Before long, as many as 6,000 Chechen refugees had arrived, along with as many as 1,500 fighters. Georgian officials say that by late last summer, the Pankisi Gorge was, in effect, Chechen territory, a place where Georgian forces ventured at their peril. ''We didn't dare come into the gorge,'' said Nika Laliashvili, a senior official with Georgia's Ministry for State Security. ''The Chechens controlled it.'' In August, under pressure from both the Americans and the Russians, Georgian officials decided to sweep the gorge of the militants. But instead of mounting a large-scale invasion, the Georgians took a more subtle approach. Officials met with village elders and told them the militants could no longer stay. ''We did not want to have a confrontation,'' said David Bakradze of Georgia's National Security Council. ''We said, 'If you won't go, then we'll kick you out.' '' The Georgians say they did not use the battalions trained by the Green Berets, but those units did stage a military exercise outside the gorge shortly before the operation began. Georgian officials declined to speak in detail about the level of resistance they encountered when they entered the gorge. But they offered one example of where, they said, Georgian forces had proved effective. Last fall, they said, they forced a group of about 30 mostly Chechen fighters back across the border. The group, they said, walked right into a force of Russian soldiers, who killed many of them. At the same time, Georgian officials described an incident in which an Arab fighter with apparent links to Al Qaeda might have been allowed to get away. Georgian officials said they believed that the man, Abu Hafsi, had been running financial operations in the gorge and had supervised the building of a military hospital there. He slipped away, presumably to Chechnya, officials said. In the Pankisi Gorge, local residents largely confirmed the government's account. Zhora Shavlokhov, headmaster of the Dumasturi Elementary School, said the 30 fighters arrived about 18 months ago and occupied the school. Mr. Shavlokhov said he did not much like the men, but they carried guns and brooked no arguments. Mr. Shavlokhov said the fighters were an odd mix: doctors, lawyers, criminals and drug addicts. Indeed, the detritus left behind filled out the details of the headmaster's story: a makeshift exercise bar was still suspended between two trees, and used hypodermic needles and empty vials lay scattered about the yard. ''The Russians killed them at the border,'' he said. A Western diplomat in Tbilisi said his government was not upset with the way the Georgians chose to move most of the militants out of the gorge. As long as the militants left the gorge -- the only inhabitable area along the Russian border -- then his government was satisfied, he said. The diplomat expressed frustration, however, that Georgian leaders were not more aggressive with the 50-odd militants still in the gorge. Chechen refugees here express a different kind of frustration. Their camps are full of families who braved snowy mountains and Russian guns in their flight from their homes, and they ask why the outside world, and particularly the American government, seems more concerned with Al Qaeda than with aggrieved civilians. ''Bush would do anything to have Russia in his coalition,'' said Baslan Gidiev, who walked across the mountains three years ago. Even so, they say they, too, are happy that the militants of the Pankisi Gorge have left. ''We admire them, and we think they are brave,'' said Ruslan Nalayev, who also left Chechnya three years ago. ''But when they are here, they bring great danger. We're glad they are gone.''
Steve Yzerman had two goals and three assists, tying a Detroit record with 5  points in a playoff game, as the Red Wings crushed the St. Louis Blues, 8-3, today and took a 2-0 lead in their second-round series. Yzerman had a goal and two assists as the Red Wings scored five goals in the  first period. Nicklas Lidstrom had two goals for the Red Wings, who are seeking  their first Stanley Cup since 1955. Vladimir Konstantinov, Darren McCarty, Martin Lapointe and Marc Bergevin also scored for Detroit. Shayne Corson, Peter  Zezel and Adam Creighton scored for the Blues. Detroit, after a four-day layoff, had been sluggish in the first game. But the Red Wings, who won a National Hockey League-record 62 games this season, were back on their form in Game 2. NHL PLAYOFFS
Faced with the news that Viacom Inc. has improved its friendly takeover offer for Paramount Communications, the rival bidder, QVC Network Inc. is considering a higher bid. Last week, both companies had bids of roughly $9.5 billion on the table, with cash components of $4.8 billion, worth about $80 a share. But in a surprising development, Viacom raised its bid on Saturday to $85 a share in cash for 51 percent of Paramount, and the rest in stock. Viacom's new $10.1 billion offer includes $5.1 billion in cash, making it richer than QVC's. There is pressure for QVC to respond within a week: the Delaware Chancery Court has agreed to hear QVC's arguments on Nov. 16 that Paramount must remove anti-takeover provisions put in place to block QVC's offer. QVC can argue that it is being treated unfairly only if it has made a bid at least as strong as Viacom's. QVC and the BellSouth Corporation have been negotiating a deal in which BellSouth, a giant regional telephone company, would put up $1.5 billion to become an equity partner in QVC's bid for Paramount. In return, BellSouth expects to become a significant shareholder in QVC and to have representation on the board. There are currently three such significant shareholders: QVC's chairman, Barry Diller; Liberty Media, and Comcast. Liberty Media is controlled by John Malone, the chief executive of Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable operator. Mr. Diller requires a consensus from the other significant shareholders in QVC. Status of Liberty Media Another huge regional phone company, Bell Atlantic, plans to buy both Tele-Communications and Liberty. BellSouth would spend about $500 million to buy out part of Liberty's stake, but Liberty would still be left with 22 percent of QVC. However, Liberty might have to sell that holding, several executives noted. The Federal Trade Commission, which must give QVC antitrust clearance before the deal can proceed, on Friday requested more information from the company. Whether Mr. Malone's role in QVC might delay the deal remains a question. Several industry analysts who have long followed both Viacom's chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, and Mr. Diller of QVC wondered how much higher the bidding for Paramount would go. Mr. Redstone is said to be firmly committed to melding his company and Paramount. Despite the bidding, the debt-to-capital ratio of Viacom, if it bought Paramount at its current offering price, would be 45 percent, according to an investment banker involved in the deal. That is far lower than the 90 percent debt-to-capital ratio Mr. Redstone took on with his purchase of Viacom in 1987. That venture paid off handsomely, turning a $400 million investment into a holding that is today worth $5 billion. That experience, and Mr. Redstone's competitive nature, might induce him to bid higher.  Redstone Plays With Own Money But this time around, Mr. Redstone has far more of his own money -- a $5 billion fortune -- at risk, according to Mario Gabelli, whose company is a shareholder in both Paramount and Viacom. Moreover, a defeat could be profitable. Paramount has promised to pay Viacom $100 million as consolation if it loses the deal, and would allow it to buy 24 million new shares at $69.14 a share. If QVC were to bid $90 a share and win, it would have to pay Viacom nearly $600 million. As for Mr. Diller, the battle for Paramount, owner of the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers and the book publisher Simon & Schuster, is his first major takeover fight. He, too, has shown an enormous competitive appetite and has been lining up the support necessary to increase his offer. If Mr. Diller loses the Paramount bidding to Mr. Redstone, he would still be chairman of QVC. Yet he has shown a strong inclination to go beyond the home shopping business, and many think he would soon be in search of another alliance that could expand his core business. Allen & Company, QVC's investment banker, a firm with a long history of deals in the entertainment industry, is also eager to win. To lose a deal to Mr. Redstone would be a big disappointment to the firm, which once worked as his investment banker, a top entertainment industry executive said. The battle for Paramount is also Allen's first hostile-takeover deal, so a success would give it an important credential as a skilled player in future fights. THE MEDIA BUSINESS
Ciena said yesterday that it had lost $70.6 million, or 22 cents a share, during the three months ended Jan. 31, as revenue tumbled 54 percent, to $162 million from $352 million a year earlier. Ciena, one of the last telecommunications equipment suppliers to be hit by the carriers' sharp slowdown in capital spending last year, also warned that sales in the current quarter would be about $100 million, well below recent projections. Ciena's shares fell $1.60 in heavy trading yesterday, to $7.60, down more than 90 percent from their 52-week high of $84.25 a year ago. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)

THE words ''elegance'' and ''recycling'' are rarely found in the same sentence. But Justin Kelly, a contractor in TriBeCa, has risen to the challenge, thanks to a client whose indoor shutters were crusted by a century's worth of paint. Mr. Kelly, 36, did not look forward to stripping the shutters and remembered that he had a couple of boxes of Victorian glass-lantern slides, small photographic plates. A second career and a dazzling special effect were born. Mr. Kelly's post-modern ''stained glass'' panels are mosaiclike color or black-and-white slides, sandwiched between plates of safety glass and framed in aluminum, architectural bronze or steel. The shutters -- and designs for shower doors, room partitions and folding screens -- can ornament any space with a gallery of cracker-size art. Clients can choose from more than 13,000 vintage slides, with images from French churches to old bridges, or have their own images transferred by computer onto acetate. ''A this-is-your-life screen could have hundreds of pictures of every person and every place in your life,'' Mr. Kelly said. The frames' screw-tight construction makes them easy to alter, in case a loved one falls out of favor. Prices range from about $1,200 for a nine-slide wall sconce to $14,500 for a large, four-panel folding screen; (212) 274-9010. Currents
The chief medical official of the Olympics applauded the international swimming federation yesterday for giving only a warning to the world champion SAMANTHA RILEY of Australia over a positive drug test. "I am very satisfied," Prince ALEXANDRE DE MERODE, chairman of the International Olympic Committee medical commission, said from London. "I think they made a decision that is fair and just. I think it was an intelligent interpretation of the rules. This decision gives credibility to the anti-doping fight." The swimming federation, FINA, announced Tuesday that it was handing Riley a strong warning after she failed a drug test at the world short-course championships in Brazil last Dec. 1. Riley, the world 100-meter and 200-meter breast-stroke champion, tested positive for the drug dextroproposyphene. The banned substance was in a prescription headache tablet given to her by her coach, SCOTT VOLKERS. The Riley case is the latest high-profile drug controversy in swimming. Earlier this month, the 15-year-old American JESSICA FOSCHI had an initial probation sanction for a positive steroids test last August turned into a two-year ban by the United States Swimming board of directors. "In light of FINA's decision to give Riley a strong warning instead of a two-year suspension, I will ask FINA to review the facts of the Jessica Foschi matter," the United States Swimming president, CAROL ZALESKI, said Tuesday. Foschi's lawyer, MARK LEVINSTEIN, said yesterday that a letter was sent to United States Swimming formally requesting a reconsideration for his Long Island client. (AP) SPORTS PEOPLE: SWIMMING
Employees of Bell Communications Research Inc. who wander into the snack room at a research center in Morristown, N.J., casually trade grins, waves and suggestions with their counterparts in Navesink, N.J., even though Navesink is 50 miles away. Sometimes the employees swap water-cooler chit-chat; other times, they hold formal conferences. The 8-foot-high Video Windows that virtually bring these distant groups into the same room are a product of a new technology intended to expand drastically the amount of data that optical fibers can carry. Optical fibers, the thin strands of glass that transmit information using pulses of light, are like huge water mains with only a trickle of water flowing through them, according to Anthony S. Acampora, a researcher at Columbia University. Just as radio listeners can choose from a broad range of channels by tuning their receivers, such devices as telephones, computers and video equipment could receive much more information over optical fibers if they all could be tuned to different frequencies of light. A single fiber connection between two users could simultaneously handle not only a telephone link but also high-definition video and a high volume of computer data.  The Limitations Professor Acampora heads the Center for Telecommunications Research at Columbia's School of Engineering. The fiber optics project has won support from the National Science Foundation, Bell Communications Research, GTE, Philips N.V. and three other companies. Scientists say that although commercial applications might be years away, the technology could speed the installation of national data highways and libraries. The capacity of existing fiber networks is severely limited by the speed of the lasers that generate optical signals, Professor Acampora said. These lasers convert electrical signals from telephones, video equipment and computers into pulses of light. "The electro-optical bottleneck is how fast we can turn lasers on and off," Professor Acampora said. The limit is 1 billion to 2 billion flashes, or bits of information, a second; fiber can carry at least 500 billion bits. An ordinary telephone line can carry only about 10 million bits a second. Sending these light pulses at different frequencies could take advantage of the fiber's full capacity. Users could tune to the frequencies they need, so no cumbersome switches would be necessary to route calls and data. Since the frequency of light determines color in the visible light band, scientists frequently talk of sending different colors of light through the fiber network. In fact, the frequencies under discussion are in the infrared range, which is invisible. Having enormous transmission capacity solves a variety of practical problems, said Stephen Weinstein, a manager at Bell Communications Research, or Bellcore, a joint enterprise of the regional Bell companies. "For one thing, you would not have to strain to compress data," he said. "You could use relatively simple devices and just blast out all the information you want."  The Problem of Distortion Transmitting color pictures requires such vast amounts of data that they are usually compressed and reconstituted after transmission. High-definition television pictures require 800 million bits of information a second. One proposal pending at the Federal Communications Commission would compress that to 20 million bits. But compression inevitably introduces some distortion, blurring fast-moving scenes. By transmitting all the data, picture quality could be improved to the point where physicians could more readily view X-rays and other medical images on remote monitors. Bellcore's two Video Windows are connected by two optical links, each capable of carrying 45 million bits of information a second. With that capacity, the signal must be compressed somewhat, because even video that is not high-definition requires 100 million to 150 million bits of information a second. 'A Sense of Naturalness' Eric J. Addeo, a research manager at Bellcore, described the Video Window as an attempt to create "virtual presence" -- the feeling that the person on the screen is really on the other side of the table. "With a near life-size image and high-quality audio, there is a sense of naturalness that is not present in typical teleconferencing," he said. Creating a nationwide network using such technology will be a much greater challenge. In conventional communications systems, calls are routed to a central switch, where the connection to the other telephone is made. Under the system envisioned by Professor Acampora's group, the central switch would be eliminated. Instead, devices would be tied into the optical highway by ports that would translate electronic signals into light of a certain frequency. The information would travel down the system until it reached a telephone, computer or other device tuned to receive it. This would overcome the barrier imposed by the limit on how fast light-sending devices can be turned on and off. Each port could send or receive up to a billion bits per second, and the system could carry data from many ports simultaneously. Over longer distances, optical amplifiers would be used to bolster the strength of the signals. In the event that the intended telephone or other receiver is not tuned to the frequency being transmitted, other devices would adjust the signals to the appropriate frequency. One difficulty to be overcome before the new optical system can be widely installed is to develop optical transmitters and receivers that can be rapidly tuned to different wavelengths. Currently, equipment can be tuned over only a small part of the optical spectrum. Professor Acampora notes rapid progress. "Four years ago we did not have optical amplifiers and we did not have the ability to rapidly tune anything," he said. "Today we have optical amplifiers and we can rapidly tune over a limited portion of the spectrum." Mr. Weinstein of Bellcore said he expected that more years of research would be needed before it became clear whether all-optical networks using multiple wavelengths of light were a practical means of carrying large amounts of data. Commercial applications might be at least a decade away, he said, adding, "This approach is a reasonable possibility for future generations of technology, but it is not the next generation." "But compression inevitably introduces some distortion, blurring fast- moving scenes. By transmitting all the data, picture quality could be improved to the point where physicians could more readily view X-rays and other medical images on remote monitors. "Bellcore's two Video Windows are connected by two optical links, each capable of carrying 45 million bits of information a second. With that capacity, the signal must be compressed somewhat, because even video that is not high-definition requires 100 million to 150 million bits of information a second."

THE 1992 CAMPAIGN
More than two million Sudanese are at risk as a severe drought and new fighting in the southern part of the country threaten the worst famine in the Sudan since 1988, when about 280,000 people died, relief officials here say. In most of the southeast, the harvest has failed and food stocks have already been exhausted. Western diplomats and relief officials say the Government in Khartoum has been massing its troops in southern towns in preparation for a large-scale "dry season" offensive against the guerrillas. Reporters in the southern Sudan have reported that fighting has intensified in the past week as the Muslim-led Government in Khartoum continues a major offensive against towns and villages held by southern rebels. United Nations aid workers said some 70,000 refugees were fleeing toward the Ugandan border to escape bombing raids north of the Kenyan and Ugandan borders and at least 30,000 others were escaping heavy ground fighting further east at Amadi, close to the remote border with Zaire. Last week, as many as 100,000 civilians, afraid of attacks and bombings, abandoned relief camps and easy access to food and in a mass exodus fled in the direction of Uganda. Relief agencies have pulled out Western workers in areas where they believe attacks are imminent. The raids have been officially denied by Khartoum. Refugees Used as Shields In previous offensives the rebels have prevented refugees from leaving the Sudan so that they can use them as shields against Government forces. "We have the makings of a colossal humanitarian crisis in the southern Sudan because of crop failure," said Philip O'Brien, head of both Unicef Sudan and Operation Lifeline Sudan, which coordinates activities for the United Nations and during 30 nongovernmental organizations. "Up to two million people have a serious food crisis starting now. In addition, if the conflict comes and is extensive, the crisis will be much, much worse. It is the worst crisis in the past four or five years." It is another tormented chapter in the 10-year civil war between the Islamic fundamentalist north and the Christian and animist south that has ravaged the south's infrastructure, fed famine and left an estimated one million people dead. Despite scores of cease-fires and high level talks, diplomats say no resolution is in sight. In the last two years, the Government has retaken all the principle towns in the south but it still does not control the countryside. In 1991, the Sudan People's Liberation Front splintered over whether the south should become independent or just seek more autonomy as the factions fight with one another. The plight of the south's people is aggravated by their isolation. For more than half the year, the rains make travel impossible, and Khartoum has strictly controlled access for the United Nations and for journalists. North Suffers Added Woes The north is also suffering from a bad harvest, bread lines, chronic fuel shortages and price increases. The fighting this year comes after a year of relative peace and the first steps toward some form of stability and more effective relief work. There was little fighting in 1993. Diplomats say the Sudan, on Washington's list of terrorist countries, may have waited to judge the outcome of American and United Nations presence in Somalia. About 300,000 people died in the civil war and famine in Somalia that prompted the United Nations intervention in December 1992. The American interest in the Sudan was underscored last April by the visit to the border areas by George E. Moose, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. There was talk of demilitarized zones and safe havens. Cease-fires were brokered. But as the United Nations success in Somalia unraveled and the international community could not agree on a course of action against the fighting in the former Yugoslavia, the Sudan as an issue disappeared again. No plans have materialized. "It is the forgotten war, the tragedy that is often swept under the rug," said a Western diplomat. "There isn't the political will in the U.S. or Europe." Early in 1993, in a sharp change of policy, the Government in Khartoum had begun allowing the United Nations and relief agencies increased access across the south reaching about 1.7 million out of the south's 4 million people. There was a significant drop in malnutrition levels, and in certain communities the first crops in years were planted. A United Nations survey showed that malnutrition rates fell from 80 percent to 11 percent among the 47,000 displaced in Ame, one of the largest camps, near the Uganda border. Yet even if some form of calm had prevailed, the crisis is far from over. Before the most recent fighting, there were about 600,000 internally displaced in the south and about two million in the north. About 400,000 Sudanese have become refugees in Zaire, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia. In a continent with a roughly 3 percent growth rate, a survey by Operation Lifeline Sudan found that in 1993, the population in the southern Sudan decreased by 1.9 percent. Recent reports from the drought stricken areas of Eastern Equatoria and Bahr-e Ghazal show a tripling of women and children in feeding centers. Last week, gunmen raided Ame, killing four people. A few days later the Government bombed the outskirts of a nearby rebel base. Now Ame is deserted as its tens of thousands of inhabitants abandonned even pots and pans and clothes and fled in panic. "It's not only a question of starting from scratch in terms of the programs," said Sally Burnheim of Operation Lifeline Sudan. "We also have to get access to them. Many have fled into the bush." Last year, the World Food program airlifted or airdropped 26,000 tons of food, sent in 24,000 tons by barge and 6,800 more by ground routes. World Food Program officials estimate conservatively that the southern Sudan will need about 219,000 tons for this coming year out of a total food aid for the country of 487,000 tons. But now unless alternatives to food airlifts can be found as the main means of access to stricken areas, relief operations will be cut down by lack of funds, American and United Nations officials say. Last month, the Sudanese Government and rebels failed to agree on a deal allowing food to be taken in overland, forcing the relief agencies to continue an expensive airlift. Costs Paid by the U.S. The United States pays about 80 percent of the airlift, which costs, exclusive of food, about $1 million a month for each of the two planes. Last year, about 35 percent of the food was airlifted or airdropped. Officials of the United States Agency for International Development say there are only enough funds until April. The World Food Program has enough food only until June. Operation Lifeline Sudan estimates that it needs $250 million for 1994, of which about $217 million will be for the World Food Program. But so far, they have raised only $10 million. "The consequences of stopping the airlift is that people will die," said Donald Petterson, the United States Ambassador to the Sudan and outspoken critic of both the Government and the rebels. "Neither side has shown readiness for fundamental compromises to make a settlement. It takes two to tango and they haven't even gotten on the ballroom floor." Correction:  February 11, 1994, Friday A picture from Agence France-Presse yesterday with an article about the threat of drought in the Sudan was transmitted in mirror image and appeared that way in some copies.

Amid tentative signs that the heady momentum of the last two months is beginning to flag, the undeclared candidacy of Ross Perot is moving into a new, more sophisticated phase, a top campaign official said today. The official, James Squires, press secretary for the Perot Petition Committee, said in an interview that in the coming month the Texas billionaire would make greater use of professional political advisers to help his campaign, possibly put some campaign commercials on television and become more specific about his views. Such a shift would be a marked but expected departure from the campaign's almost exclusive reliance on enthusiastic but untutored volunteers, whose primary focus has been to gather enough signatures to try to qualify Mr. Perot for the ballot in the 50 states. "We have to start doing something other than petition drives" Mr. Squires said. Morning for Perot? In recent weeks, Edward J. Rollins, the co-manager of the Perot committee who is in charge of its day-to-day operations, has employed a number of professional political consultants to tackle chores like building crowds for rallies, conducting voter-registration drives and handling the hordes of reporters and camera crews covering Mr. Perot's public appearances. In addition, the Perot Committee has hired Hal Riney, a San Francisco advertising specialist who created the "Morning in America" theme for Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign. Mr. Rollins has said that Mr. Perot would declare his candidacy in July, but Mr. Squires and Thomas W. Luce 3d, the committee's chairman, said today that no date had been set for such an announcement. The change in complexion of Mr. Perot's effort comes at a time when a spate of public-opinion polls show a slowing of his meteoric rise and some embryonic doubts about the plausibility of a Perot Presidency. A Washington Post-ABC News nationwide poll conducted June 24 through June 28 placed Mr. Perot in a virtual dead heat with President Bush and Bill Clinton. In a similar poll conducted by the Post and ABC from May 31 to June, Mr. Perot led Mr. Bush by 6 points and Mr. Clinton by 10. Other polls have shown a similar erosion of Mr. Perot's standing. In a telephone survey of 810 adults in 12 Southern states conducted June 21 through June 24 by The Atlanta Constitution, Mr. Perot tied for second place with Mr. Clinton, 10 points behind the President. In Massachusetts, a statewide poll of 400 registered voters conducted June 24 through June 26 indicated that the Dallas independent also trailed Mr. Clinton by a margin of 28 percent to 26 percent, with Mr. Bush third with 23 percent. Earlier this month, the same poll had Mr. Perot leading both his possible rivals by 13 points. "It's like the bloom is off the rose," said Gerry Cherzinsky, president of KRC Communications Research, which conducted the Massachusetts poll for The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV. These polls suggest that Mr. Perot has been scarred in recent days by the bitter charges being flung back and forth between himself and surrogates for President Bush, and by a reluctance to provide clear answers to some pressing voter concerns. "I think Bush's attacks have had an impact," Mr. Cherzinsky said. "My belief has always been that the more people know about Perot, the less people will like him. That's only normal for any politician." Aides to Mr. Perot say they are not concerned about these polls, noting that the electorate has been extremely volatile all year and there are months to go before the election. "What we are seeing is not unexpected," Mr. Squires said. "When you go up in the polls as fast as he did, you're going to bump off the ceiling sometime." Some political analysts say that Mr. Perot has perhaps also been hurt by his unwillingness to be specific on issues. That reluctance was on display Monday night. During an appearance on a 90-minute program on ABC-TV, Mr. Perot did not directly answer the question of whether he would allow homosexuals in the armed forces. And when asked whether he would sign the Freedom of Choice Act, which would provide a Federal statutory guarantee of abortion rights, he would say only that abortion was a woman's decision. Mr. Perot also declined to specify how he would make good on his oft-stated view that the way to stop violence in the United States was to "get guns out of the hands of violent people". Still, toward the end of the show, which featured questions from studio audiences in 10 cities, Mr. Perot virtually endorsed the economic proposals that had been put forward by Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator who dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination this year. "What is the most impressive platform I've seen so far? Senator Tsongas's platform, 'An Economic Call to Arms,' " Mr. Perot said, brandishing the small booklet that Mr. Tsongas and his aides passed out at virtually every campaign stop. Mr. Perot added, "There's a lot of good ideas here." Mr. Perot has been in accord with Mr. Tsongas on a number of economic issues, including a cut in the capital gains tax to spur investment and opposition to a middle-class tax cut. But as he left the ABC studios, Mr. Perot declined to answer a reporter's question of whether he favored a five-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, another of Mr. Tsongas' economic tenets.
Because of an editing error, a report in the World Briefing column on Wednesday about the appointment of Demetrius Perricos as acting executive chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission misstated the retirement date of the current chairman, Hans Blix.

LEAD: Christian Lacroix and Karl Lagerfeld have clearly emerged as the pillars of the new fashion season, as the fall and winter openings hurtle along. Intriguingly, they are on opposite sides of the fashion spectrum. Christian Lacroix and Karl Lagerfeld have clearly emerged as the pillars of the new fashion season, as the fall and winter openings hurtle along. Intriguingly, they are on opposite sides of the fashion spectrum. The Lacroix mood, pegged to short skirts, continues rollicking and frivolous. Mr. Lagerfeld, who has recently contributed to the vogue for playful fashions, has changed his approach. Spearheading the drive toward long, slender clothes, he said he found the earlier fluffy styles ''vulgar.'' In his first collection under his own name for Stillmann, a West German manufacturer, Mr. Lagerfeld makes a strong case for sophisticated clothes. Skinny calf-length black knitted skirts for day are chic under wide capes. The Figure Counts A smaller wrap is a knitted stole made with one sleeve; the other end is wrapped around the body. In addition to assisting the woman who has trouble keeping a stole in place, these knitted wraps provide a shot of color for black. One black dress was shown with a sleeved stole on each arm, one red and one yellow. The long slender styles can be as seductive in their way as short skirts are in theirs. As they cling to the body, the long slender skirts demand a great figure. So the designer wisely offers alternatives: wide-legged trousers and long pleated skirts. A one-button gray wool suit with a calf-length full pleated skirt could be worn with ease by any woman anywhere. But Mr. Lagerfeld's greatest accomplishments are filmy, svelte black lace dresses that stop just below the calf and are, for the sophisticated woman, the antithesis of poufs and bubbles. A Signature Changes The designer applied the same quiet touch to his collection for Chanel, shown Monday morning. It was the best Chanel collection since Chanel died, in 1971. You could tell it was Chanel by the gold buttons and the chain belt, but the slim, supple silhouettes were Mr. Lagerfeld's own contribution. After five years he has imposed his stamp on the house, substituting edelweiss and violets for the camellia, long the house signature. The clothes were both subtle and sophisticated, with no gimmicks at all. Mr. Lagerfeld banished ruffles and poufs. Instead he showed calf-length skirts, wide-legged pants and eminently wearable evening dresses. Indeed, a woman could wear one of the beautifully proportioned short jacket suits from the time she went to work in the morning, on into evening. Ivory sweater-jackets over tailored pleated shirtwaist dresses were one of the designer's best evening suggestions. Other good ideas were frilly blouses - some a shade too fussy -worn with black trousers, and black evening suits, best with lace blouses. Mr. Lagerfeld has succeeded in making grown-up clothes for grown-up women. Brisk Sales for LaCroix Proving that coexistence is as feasible in French fashion as it is in the French Government, the fluffy Lacroix Luxe collection is being ordered by stores even before its official debut Tuesday morning. Eight hundred pieces were bought Saturday, the first day the clothes were available. Prices ranged from $4,000 to $20,000 an outfit for these modified versions of Mr. Lacroix's couture styles shown in January. Mainly for evening, the collection focuses on fitted suits with front zipper closings and on coats and dresses with snug waistlines and short flaring skirts. Fur sleeves and jeweled embroidery add to the luxury look. A grillwork print against a patchwork of different colors, along with tapestry effects and rose patterns, were among the outstanding fabrics. The best seller so far is a long-jacket theater suit in the grillwork pattern as well as in a solid-color cinnamon silk and wool fabric. The Softer Shoulder Two of the wilder French designers, Claude Montana and Jean-Paul Gaultier, have profited from the emergence of a sober side to fashion. With all the talk of hemlines, few observers are paying much attention to the softening of the shoulders, a big change in fall fashions. Claude Montana, who introduced mammoth shoulders a decade ago, is profiting from their deflation. His clothes now have a more human-scale look. He still acts like a sculptor in cloth or leather. This time his best jacket is shaped gently at the waist and flares out to an undulating peplum, which is wired at the edges to hold its ripples. Wide circles of fabric or fur cover the neck and part of the shoulders; they are a cross between collars and capelets and look almost cozy. Covering for the Calf Hemlines? Forget about calf length. Mr. Montana's hemlines hover around the ankles. But there are not that many of them. The bulk of the collection involves pants, some high-waisted. The most original color combinations for jackets and pants are red with wine or plum. Black pants and soft blouses in blue-gray silk the color of the Paris sky are another appealing combination. Evening clothes focus on black pants suits with satin details; they look like men's dinner clothes. A long jacket has one satin lapel that curves around itself in a spiral effect. The entire collection showed Mr. Montana in top form. Jean-Paul Gaultier's shows in La Villette, a former slaughterhouse on the Paris outskirts, are generally planned to shock the establishment and send up fashion. Not this time. A straightforward presentation showed off the clothes, which were fine. There was no sign of Mr. Gaultier's preoccupation with nudity and underwear. Gold for Evening Jersey jumpsuits, capelets that just covered the shoulders, trousers with pleats on the insides of the legs and looser jackets, including parkas, were among the Gaultier fashion messages. He continues the jackets shaped like leotards that he introduced last spring, worn over shiny tights, one of the many styles in stretch fabrics. Evening clothes are all in gold; a burnt-orange shade is memorable for day. A Gaultier show is interesting when he is not trying to make the audience squirm. Issey Miyake's collection does not have the lyricism evident in other seasons, but the clothes are sturdy, wearable and inventive. This world-class designer from Tokyo is scheduled for an exhibition at the Museum of Decorative Arts here, in October. Three-tiered dresses, capelet jackets with wide-legged pants and knitted cashmere sweaters and coats, all in luminous beige tones, are some of his best contributions to the season.

We were dismayed at the position taken by Mayor Christine Korff in regard to the issue of Home Depot $(''A Proposal for a Home Deport in Port Chester Draws Fire in Rye,'' March 23$). Her ''class wars'' comments were divisive, simplistic and clearly demonstrate her blatant disregard for the residents of her own city as well as those of neighboring towns. Mayor Korff shortchanges the residents of Port Chester by misrepresenting the facts. She states that Port Chester ''welcomes the traffic'' Home Depot will bring -- but in reality, if situated where proposed, a significant portion of the truck and car traffic will flow through Rye, not Port Chester. Nevertheless, this situation poses a clear threat to the safety of all surrounding streets and diminishes the environment for both Port Chester and Rye residents who live near the site -- apparently not of any concern to Ms. Korff, who resides at the opposite end of town. Further, it will not necessarily bring consumer dollars to the rest of Port Chester. The merchants of Port Chester will benefit most by a coordinated business and traffic plan, which routes consumers directly through their own city and encourages visitors to spend time exploring, dining, shopping and enjoying the new Main Street renovations. This will not happen with Home Depot as a merchant or with the traffic flow as proposed. Mayor Korff refuses to see the reality of this situation. It is time for the Mayor of Port Chester to begin promoting responsible city planning, to begin seeking long-term solutions that enhance the quality of life for all the people of Port Chester, to begin working with her neighbors and to stop engaging in politically divisive behavior.

CAL ABRAMS was buried in his Brooklyn Dodgers uniform yesterday in North Lauderdale, Fla. He was the son of a Russian immigrant father, a Jewish kid from Brooklyn whose proudest moment was the day he slipped into his Dodgers uniform and stepped onto Ebbets Field. It was late in the 1949 season, Jackie Robinson having broken the color barrier two years before and established himself as an indispensable piece of the Dodgers' puzzle. Yet Robinson was still mostly treated as a black man reluctantly let through the turnstile of white America, and though Abrams may have been a Dodger to the delight of the large Brooklyn Jewish population, inside the clubhouse he apparently felt that he was not exactly walking on a welcome mat. ''My father had tremendous respect for Jackie, for what he went through,'' Ellen Abrams said from her parents' home in Tamarac, Fla. ''He was a minority, too.'' At 47, Ellen Abrams is like most baby boomers, with hazy memories, if any, of the Brooklyn Dodgers, of her father's three years as Jackie Robinson's teammate. But she and her three siblings had the benefit of growing up with a walking, talking history book. ''He liked to talk about how he used to bring food to Jackie on the bus whenever they stopped someplace Jackie wasn't allowed in,'' she said. ''He was proud to have contributed because he also lived that life.'' In his 1992 book, ''Ellis Island to Ebbets Field,'' the author Peter Levine wrote that Cal Abrams believed most antagonisms he endured to be little more than ''jibes and taunts,'' the opposition's attempt to throw him off his game. But Ellen Abrams's younger brother, 37-year-old David, said his father painfully felt an anti-Semitic sting, especially during his early days with the team. ''He said there were times when he was told there was no room on the team bus and to go ride in a station wagon with the equipment man,'' David Abrams said. ''Jackie Robinson and other first black players at least had the benefit of the owner saying, 'You have to accept this.' But that wasn't said for a Jewish player.'' Subtle bigotry can be more insidious, downright mind-altering. David Abrams, for instance, said his father always suspected that his manager in 1950, Charlie Dressen, benched him after a torrid hitting streak because he didn't fancy a Jewish player forcing his way into the everyday lineup. Maury Allen, a sportswriter who later wrote about Abrams for The New York Post, said the other day that when he checked old Dodger box scores, he discovered many games against right-handed pitchers when the lefty-hitting outfielder inexplicably did not play. From his home in Florida, Harold Rosenthal, a respected sportswriter who covered those Dodger teams for The New York Herald Tribune, scoffed at these charges, particularly the one about Abrams's being forced off the bus. But Ellen Abrams said that if any of her siblings knew the skinny on their father's career, it was her youngest brother. ''It's been his passion to learn about that whole era,'' she said. Fifty years after Robinson became the most important athlete of the 20th century, an ESPN special report last night reported claims by late 1940's players that actual strike votes were taken by at least three teams before Robinson's first game. It was a different time, reporters and players being far more compatible than they are today. But considering the only mention of the potential boycott was in Rosenthal's paper, this should only dramatically increase one's appreciation for what Robinson achieved. He had no public shoulder to lean on, no agent to cry to. Robinson set an unmatchable standard of courage. He should be the ultimate inspiration for every contemporary sports pioneer -- be it Europeans facing resentments in pro basketball and hockey, Japanese infiltrating the major leagues or blacks trying to push their way into management jobs. It wasn't just that Robinson played, but in the uncompromising way he played. That's how the history books tell it, and that's the way it got passed down from a Jewish man who had the honor of playing alongside him. ''My father always said that if Jackie Robinson could deal with what he did, then how could he not deal with what he had to?'' David Abrams said. ''His dream was to be a Dodger, no matter what.''

The Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan, has been hospitalized in Washington, fueling concerns about his health. Mr. Farrakhan underwent surgery, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said in an interview with WGN-TV in Chicago tonight. Mr. Jackson did not say when the surgery occurred, but he said it was to relieve discomfort. Mr. Farrakhan was admitted on  Tuesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for Howard University Hospital, Donna Brock, said today, adding that she could not give his condition or say what he was being treated for. A statement released by Leonard F. Muhammad, the Nation of Islam chief of staff and Mr. Farrakhan's son-in-law, said that he was ''stable and resting'' and that ''doctors have informed his family and Nation of Islam officials that the minister's treatment continues to be successful and his prognosis is excellent.'' Prostate cancer was diagnosed in Mr. Farrakhan in 1991.
An American expert on terrorism in Indonesia, Sidney Jones, who has published authoritative reports on the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah, was served with deportation papers. She said she had been given no explanation. The head of Indonesia's intelligence agency, General Hendropriyono, has complained in the past week that her reports on the group, which has been linked to Al Qaeda and is accused of the deadly bombings in Bali in 2002, were inaccurate and harmful to Indonesia's interests.

The news that North Korea has agreed to multilateral talks has been greeted with relief and hope from Moscow to Beijing to Washington. The United States has consistently insisted on multilateral talks with the North, while North Korea had been calling for talks only between the United States and North Korea. Now that North Korea has agreed to talks that will include Japan, China, Russia and South Korea, the Bush administration is focusing on the need to dismantle the North's nuclear-weapons program. However, the issue of multilateral versus bilateral talks is only peripheral to the nuclear crisis, and the prospect for resolving the yearlong standoff between the United States and North Korea remains dim. If the United States offers nothing but a demand that North Korea abandon its nuclear program, the meetings will be useless. If there is nothing to discuss, why even meet? For almost a year, American policy has been to offer minimal concessions to the North and continue to demand the scrapping of its nuclear program. This policy has only increased the tension -- and continuing it is unlikely to reduce tension regardless of how many other countries there are at the meetings. Furthermore, it does not matter how many countries are at the negotiating table, because the conflict is primarily between the United States and North Korea. What matters are the policies of these two countries, and whether they are willing to negotiate. If the United States and North Korea do not resolve their differences, the presence of China -- or Russia, South Korea or Japan -- will not lead to a different outcome. In recent weeks there have been indications from the administration that it may be willing to make some kind of offer. In a small but encouraging sign, one administration official said the United States was ''prepared to look at a process that addresses North Korea's concerns.'' North Korea clearly does not wish to go nuclear: if it wanted to, it would have done so long ago. North Korea has consistently maintained that its foremost desire in return for scrapping its nuclear program is a security guarantee from the United States. This is the key issue: whether North Korea has genuine security concerns. If it does not, and is using the nuclear issue only as a form of blackmail or extortion, then it will be relatively easy to call its bluff. The United States can simply agree not to attack North Korea if it will agree to dismantle its nuclear-weapons program. If North Korea actually means what it says, then a resolution of the crisis is fairly straightforward. Countries and leaders respond to the incentives and penalties. In the case of North Korea, being ordered to disarm creates the incentive not to disarm. If North Korea's leaders give in to pressure in this instance, who's to say they won't be pressured again? For its part, the United States must decide on a coherent policy. Its current policy appears to be one of waiting and hoping that North Korea will either collapse or reform. Getting locked in a confrontation with an unpopular foreign leader may be emotionally satisfying and play well domestically, but it is a risky strategy to follow in international politics. American pressure almost guarantees that North Korea will respond with pressure of its own. A policy of nonnegotiation is also risky in a strategic sense. First, it makes the United States essentially reactive in nature. Second, to not negotiate is to abjure incremental steps in favor of raising the stakes and hoping for the big win -- or loss. The most likely outcomes of this strategy are all negative. It could result in a war that could cost millions of lives, many of them American, and place the United States and China against each other on the peninsula, as they were in 1950. Even if war does not occur and North Korea collapses, it will likely be chaotic, costly and violent. The major powers will most likely be drawn into more involvement on the peninsula. The least likely outcome from this policy is gradual North Korean economic and political reform and a reduction of tension. The North Korean regime is brutal and abhorrent, and everyone would like to see it disappear or at least modify its ways. The question is how best to achieve that goal. Current United States policy is essentially an absence of policy. If the United States goes to the talks without anything to discuss, it will not matter whether they are multilateral or bilateral. More important than the structure of the talks is the substance of the negotiations. What North Korea Wants David Kang, professor of business and government at Dartmouth, is co-author of the forthcoming ''Nuclear North Korea: A Debate on Engagement Strategies.''
Oddly, ''Freedom: A History of US,'' 16 episodes charting the nation's pursuit of liberty from Bunker Hill to the World Trade Center attack, does not address the last enslaved American institution: PBS. Didactic, worthy and irritatingly timid, the ''Freedom'' documentary, which begins on Sunday night, signals that at long last the time has come to consider privatizing public television or turning it over to the state. When a network dedicated to serving the public interest is tethered by both government financing and corporate largesse, the result is, well, ''Freedom: A History of US.'' The problem is not that the series is boring. ''Freedom,'' does not dare to be boring enough. Its creators felt compelled to fluff up this simple, child-friendly look at American history with celebrity voice-overs (Tom Hanks as Lincoln, Brad Pitt as James K. Polk). And that is because public television is not allowed to be commercial, but it is expected to be popular -- a conundrum that leads directly to PBS pledge drive concerts featuring Yanni, John Tesh and the Celtic Tenors. It is less obvious why PBS cannot be as painfully dull as it wants (though it didn't hold back last week: ''Frontline'' devoted an hour to whether someone else really wrote Shakespeare's plays). Now and then it should startle us with an imaginative, unsparing and counterintuitive look at a subject that commercial television would never address. ''Freedom'' does neither. Instead, it falls into that all too frequent PBS category of commendable public television shows that one does not want to watch but thinks others should. The project was brought to PBS by a family of accomplished documentary filmmakers, Philip B. Kunhardt III; his father, Philip Jr.; and son, Peter W., and their partner, Nancy Steiner, a former NBC producer. The Kunhardts, whose previous works for PBS include a 10-part series on the American presidency, based this series on the popular history textbooks by Joy Hakim. Soon after Sept. 11 General Electric signed on as the sole corporate sponsor -- the sober patriotism was ideally suited to the mood of the nation. Katie Couric, the co-anchor of NBC's ''Today'' show, who before 9/11 had agreed to be the series's host, proved an ideal choice for G.E., which owns NBC. As a theme, ''Freedom'' is unassailable and even safer than motherhood, which can, of course, seem sexist. The series takes a solemn, self-congratulatory look at the American experience -- with regular pangs of contrition for injustices against women, blacks and American Indians. Some segments may cover ground not all schoolchildren or parents are familiar with: John Muir (Sean Connery), the turn-of-the-century environmentalist, or ''Appleton's Journal'' (with Julia Roberts), a periodical that announced plans for the Statue of Liberty. But the telling is very familiar to PBS veterans -- lots of Ken Burns-style black-and-white photographs and mournful banjo music. There are some distinctive grace notes along the way. The theme song, ''I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free,'' sung by Nina Simone, is lovely. Most of the visual material, especially old news footage, is artfully chosen and, especially in segments dealing with the civil rights movement, goes beyond the classic stock images that television has emblazoned in our minds. One memorable black-and-white shot of a boy, watching from a tree above a crowd listening to Martin Luther King, evokes the moment in a fresh way. So do shots of the scuffed shoes of blacks walking to work and church during the 1955 Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott. The best moments in fact are found in the Civil War and civil rights segments, subjects that PBS has already covered well and extensively. The worst moments come in the final episode, when the filmmakers try to tie the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 into their theme. While it may be perfectly reasonable for President Bush, in a stump speech, to blame Islamic terrorism on enemies who ''hate our freedom,'' it is a bit thin to rely on this assertion alone in a 16-part look at American social history. Whatever grievances are harbored by Islamic fundamentalists, it is hard to believe that the Bill of Rights tops the list. Sept. 11 would fit in smoothly in a 16-part series about the United States as the last superpower. Here, it feels forced. The writers try to wedge the connection in further with a quick reference to how the battle against terrorism could impinge on civil rights. The show basks in a glow of good intentions. The president and Laura Bush give their blessings to the series in the first episode. ''Ours is a history of heroic deeds performed on behalf of human liberty,'' Mrs. Bush tells the camera. Then G.E. gives its blessing. The PBS distinction between ''underwriters'' and commerical sponsors is increasingly blurry. The pompous black-and-white corporate ads for G.E. that precede each segment are almost indistinguishable from the series itself. Wouldbe historical footage of the first light bulb, an electric oven, a rocket taking off, an X-ray and a sonogram flash across the scene with hypnotizing speed. ''Over the years, we've been proud to present the world some amazing things,'' a deep baritone declares, ''including the program you will see tonight.'' Corporations are increasingly reluctant to finance programming that is not somehow linked to their fields: Exxon just pulled out of ''Masterpiece Theater'' after 32 years, saying it wanted to use its money for environmental and health projects. It apparently felt that those causes would better offset negative images of the oil industry than would ''The Forsyte Saga.'' G.E. provided three-quarters of the series's $4 million budget. Foundations that gave less money get a more perfunctory written credit. THE TV WATCH

BANDS will play, street entertainers strut and artists offer works in the 21st annual SoNo Arts Celebration Saturday and next Sunday. The outdoor festival, which last year lured more than 85,000 visitors, will again be staged in the South Norwalk waterfront historic district. Among warehouses rebuilt into museums, galleries and boutiques, nurtured with brick walks, gaslight-style street lights and sea views, music of all kinds and dance performances will play out on four stages. Other highlights of the festival include a parade of handcrafted giant puppets, a kinetic sculpture race and a band performance honoring more than 400 volunteers. Children's activities, filling an entire street, will feature hands-on workshops, life-size puzzles of sea creatures presented by the Norwalk Maritime Aquarium, animal olympics and what is being called a ''gutter regatta.'' An international food court will offer Thai, Southwestern, Italian, Middle Eastern and traditional treats. The festival, now grown to 150 juried artists and artisans from across the United States, originated with ''12 artists in lawn chairs on a weekend,'' said Sue Brown, exhibiting arts chairwoman and a board member of the event. As South Norwalk became increasingly revitalized, the celebration grew. Friendships and romances flourished. Ms. Brown, also an exhibiting jeweler, met the painter David Gordon at the 1991 celebration; they were married recently. Arts and crafts remain at the heart of the celebration -- painting to sculpture to photography, ceramics to wearable art. Although museum quality is stressed, Ms. Brown said, ''We also try to encourage new artists and attempt to present affordable work.'' Prices range from $5 to $5,000. Among highlights are Roger Gandelman's art glass perfume bottles. ''After blowing the glass, he slices it, creating facets, like cutting a precious gem to reveal its interior,'' Ms. Brown said. The woodworker Deb Fanelli will offer salad bowls and wood utensils that fit into a base to form a sculpture. ''Even her booth, created of different types of wood, is a sculpture -- a giant replica of her products,'' Ms. Brown said. Susan Jordhamo will display whimsical handbags crafted of fiber with human and animal motifs. Gary Recchia and Sharon Hosely, past award winners, work primarily in terra cotta, using motifs like rabbits and lizards incorporated with Indian symbols. Richard Calvo, a photographer who works in black and white, focuses on landscapes and textures. The jeweler Sue Brown will showcase silver and gold pins and collages with black coral and pearls. And the painter David Gordon will display land and seascapes in luminous colors in a variety of mediums. ''This show brings fine art and fine craft to a comfortable environment, right into our neighborhood,'' Ms. Brown said. Rain or shine, the free event will take place on Saturday from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M., the block party from 8 P.M. to midnight, and on Sunday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. The number to call for more information is the SoNo Arts Celebration hot line: (203) 866-7616.

LEAD: The photographers outnumbered the drug dealers Monday night along Restaurant Row, the block of West 46th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues that has become the temporary touchstone for New York City's agonized struggle with crack. The photographers outnumbered the drug dealers Monday night along Restaurant Row, the block of West 46th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues that has become the temporary touchstone for New York City's agonized struggle with crack. Throughout the night and early yesterday morning, frequent police patrols, both uniformed and not - ''I've never seen so many bosses down here,'' said one officer -passed strolling bands of Guardian Angels, pursued by camera crews and columnists in the stifling air. The transvestites stared, transfixed by the bizarre. The temperature was proverbially hot, but tempers were not. Politesse seemed to be the order of the night, especially between the Angels and the beat cops, who feel no special love for these muscled young men whose presence on the street, at the request and subsidy of 15 restaurant owners, is viewed by many of the officers as a public humiliation. ''I think the idea of the Guardian Angels is fine, but it doesn't always manifest itself very well,'' said another police officer, who said that given all the attention, he preferred anonymity. ''The problem is that there are good and bad Angels like there are good and bad cops and good and bad reporters. And some of them are pretty young, and they try to use their muscles instead of their brains.'' But the Angels are undoubtedly a draw, to tourists as well as reporters. Vern B. and Leonore Moore of Toronto like the Joe Allen's restaurant at home, so they came to the source at 343 West 46th Street, both Sunday and Monday evenings. ''I must say, when we came here Sunday, I was pretty shook up,'' said Mr. Moore, recently retired, who had been told about the stabbing Saturday night of a 16-year-old Guardian Angel, Illya Lichtenberg. ''The doorman said to be careful, and I thought, 'Cripes! Maybe we're naive.' '' Mrs. Moore punched her husband's arm and said: ''I'm not naive! I wasn't the least bit afraid.'' Mr. Moore smiled crookedly, chagrined. ''I must admit I was glad to see those Guardian Angels,'' he said. ''And now it's the cleanest street in New York,'' Mrs. Moore said. That is a significant change from a week ago, before the Guardian Angels began their patrols, residents said. John Shackelford manages the five buildings, all of them squalid residential hotels, that embody the now notorious street corner of Eighth Avenue at 46th Street. From a humid little office in the building next to St. Luke's Lutheran Church, Mr. Shackelford can see ''the dealing and the smoking and the fighting over turf and who's selling the bad stuff,'' he said in a talk around midnight yesterday. Matters had worsened in the past month, he said, after about a dozen crack dealers were evicted from the buildings and started dealing on the street , where the summer heat would have brought them anyway. ''I've been in a lot of fights with dealers,'' said Mr. Shackelford, who wears rings on nearly every finger and a zircon earring. ''But I'm a religious man,'' he added, ''and I don't fear no man.'' The problem, he said, was that there were few police officers on patrol in the early hours, and that the city would not or could not send more. ''When the cops went home at 2 in the morning, from 2 A.M. to 8 A.M. it was like Vietnam out there. You wouldn't set foot outside that door. ''The Angels are the best thing that's ever happened to this neighborhood,'' he said. Complaints on 47th and 49th On the stoop outside the office, a woman was asked about complaints from residents of 47th and 49th Streets that the crack dealers had simply moved their operations. ''I don't live there,'' she said, shrugging. ''I live here.'' For the Rev. Kathleen Mandeville, vicar of St. Clement's Episcopal Church on 46th Street between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, the residents' work to secure an efficient receiver for the buildings, the nonprofit Clinton Housing Development Company, was more important than the restaurant owners' importing Guardian Angels. It was Clinton Housing that went to housing court and evicted the dealers a month ago. ''You want to empower people rather than bring in outsiders to solve their problems,'' Ms. Mandeville said. ''You need mass-based community action organized around an issue, which is how drugs and economics come into play in midtown, rather than have the merchants do it.'' The Angels were fine, she said. ''But the question is who are they working for, and who sets the rules, and that needs to be addressed.'' 'Well-Behaved Crackheads' Another resident of Restaurant Row, who asked not to be identified, said the block was well-patrolled and had never been very dangerous. He said the real problem was at the corners, near the avenues. ''The crackheads are pretty well-behaved, unsightly but not really threatening,'' he said. ''This is an issue just because crack is lapping up against the middle class. The biggest whiners in New York are the restaurant owners.'' He said he often returned home at night to find crack users smoking the powerful cocaine derivative on his stoop. ''That's unpleasant, but they usually say good evening,'' he said. ''I got home tonight around 7 to find a TV cameraman there, and he didn't move an inch or say hello.'' In the former Cafe de France, donated for the use of the Guardian Angels, there are five army cots, a shower, two televisions and two telephones. Two Angels wearing red berets festooned with animal tails lounged in front of a mural of two French milkmaids in Touraine. It was after the 6 P.M. news and well before the 11 o'clock edition. The Angels' founder, Curtis Sliwa, was free to talk. As he described his goal of clearing crack dealers from 42d Street to 49th Street and as far west as 10th Avenue, he rubbed his midriff, as if he had indigestion. Feasting With 'Angels' That led to a discussion of the food the restaurants were providing the Angels - ribs and all the fixings from Joe Allen's this night. ''Now we've got all this food, a lot of it these guys can't even pronounce,'' Mr. Sliwa said. The main excitement of the night came just after 11 P.M., when a young man, Raimundo Vargas, fell from the fifth-floor fire escape of a building at 46th Street and Ninth Avenue. Luckily, he hit an awning before he hit the sidewalk. At the Cafe de France, a witness said, Mr. Sliwa emerged to tell photographers and a French television crew, ''It's on the radio - somebody went out a window.'' The photographers raced; the writers ambled. At the scene, ambulances and patrol cars blocked half the avenue. The police did their work while the Angels milled about, keeping back a sparse crowd. Pens sparkled in the flash of cameras, recording quotes like: ''He was a quiet guy; he kept to himself.'' Mr. Vargas was taken to a hospital. Just before 2 A.M., two police officers stood at the corner of 46th and Eighth. An Angel patrol walked by. A transvestite started to cross the street, then turned, pulling down a halter top and sticking out a tongue. A wild-eyed man, looking for crack, turned in circles. Two horse-drawn carriages, their occupants staring, clattered uptown.

The Federal Reserve yesterday approved the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc., a combination that would create the world's largest financial services company, subject to the divestiture of some key insurance activities within five years. The Fed action removes the last obstacle to the merger and allows for the deal to be completed by early next month. The Justice Department also announced yesterday that it had no antitrust problems with the merger, which would create a new company, to be called Citigroup, with assets of $751 billion and operations in banking, brokerage and insurance businesses. The Fed will also require Citigroup to divest itself of a number of businesses within the next two years in order to comply with the 1956 Banking Holding Company Act. A bill to overturn that 1956 law, which would allow Citigroup to be created with very few divestitures, is now wending its way through Congress. If that bill is not approved, Citigroup would be faced with having to sell the Travelers insurance underwriting operations -- along with its real estate management and investment operations, the trading of physical commodities and its oil and gas exploration business. The Fed, however, did agree to allow Salomon Smith Barney, the securities arm of Travelers, to continue many of its securities activities for two years.
Off and on for months, a bulldozer has been scratching around on the grassy lot down near the end of my block, rattling me out of bed before 7 A.M. I would resent it less if I knew why. Dirt has moved from one pile to another, with no discernible program. The very fact that excavators have arrived in my remote neck of the East Village is testament to the fate of J.R. He was the block's shady patriarch, our enigmatic alpha-neighbor. Until he went ''away,'' as we've learned to say here euphemistically, he protected us from noisy progress. For two decades, J.R headed up a vibrant heroin bazaar on the stoop next to a dingy midblock Laundromat. Appropriately, he and his colleagues dubbed themselves ''the Laundromat Crew,'' and stamped their heroin ''Laundromat'' too. It was so enduringly popular among college kids that it has been mythologized in literature and music. The Crew members lived among us -- or we among them -- in a bemused coalition: Puerto Ricans and yuppies, poets and punks. But the teeming sidewalks always belonged to the Crew. The rest of us were greeted vociferously when we passed. But pass we must. If I stopped to tie a shoelace, a firm voice would goose me along: Keep walking, keep walking, guy. I put up with the second-class relegation for 15 years. We all did. As long as J.R. was in charge, we knew, his would be the only crimes here. That was our dirty compromise. J.R.'s career was a fixation of mine nonetheless. He was the first person who greeted me on the hot afternoon in 1981 when I landed here. He was 26 then and had spent time in the military, his only experience off the block. At 22, I had just arrived from Kalamazoo, Mich. Here we were, both ebullient, with little money and enormous ambition, I thought. He was less generous. ''Great,'' J.R. spat as I tramped past him in the lobby that day, ''another white fag on the block.'' Over the years, as J.R. went gray and I went bald, his tolerance for me blossomed. I doubt he ever learned my name. But he never threw brickbats again. Meanwhile, his customers lined up 15 deep outside the Laundromat to crease tiny envelopes into their palms. Rooftop spotters transmitted warnings to the sellers down below using cries of Spanish code words like Feo and Bajando. On some nights, their canopy of cries could seem as mysterious and beautiful as a jungle aviary. They were purportedly doing $50,000 a week in business, though I often wondered where the money went. J.R. cultivated a Spartan life. He didn't even own a car. I have since learned that he helped many people with rent or veterinary bills they couldn't otherwise afford. But such token charity can't consume $2.6 million a year. The denouement, when it came two years ago, was a scene out of a dime-store novel. In seeming slow motion, an army of officers arrived just before 11 P.M. A helicopter whirred overhead, projecting a cone of light over the dingy coin-op, where Crew members were handcuffed in clumsy succession. Well after midnight, J.R., then 41, made a Billy Jack-like appearance. The cops cuffed him with a flourish, I'm told by witnesses. His doting mother, who swings an unbending leg when she walks, gripped his shirt sleeve and unleashed a surreal and memorable cry. I was curious to read that J.R., whom the tabloids would dub ''Little John Gotti,'' didn't spring for a fancy attorney, and instead of fighting the charges, had his lawyer negotiate a plea. He was sentenced last fall to a dozen years, his first-ever trip to jail. The rest of the Crew got stiff sentences, too. News of their disposition fluttered down upon the block like black organza. And the earth-moving equipment followed. All winter long the speculation was wild about what the new construction might bring. A police station. AIDS housing. N.Y.U. dorms. Last month, the construction crew posted a permit for 85 apartments over six floors, but one of the foremen undermined the sign's authority. ''It's 125 luxury units on seven floors,'' he was telling people. As I stood over the muddy hole the other day, I marveled at how one gaping mystery has supplanted another. And then a tempting idea entered my mind: What if there's no building at all? What if, somewhere in that turbid crevice, J.R. has stashed his treasure? Could this wheezing and pounding be directed by him, to remove or replace or replenish the hoard? Then another thought struck: Keep walking, keep walking, guy.  David France is writing a book on F.B.I. surveillance of gay- liberation groups.
LEAD: A 9-year-old Staten Island boy was shot in the back from a passing vehicle as he walked down Castleton Avenue near his home in St. George yesterday afternoon, the police said. A 9-year-old Staten Island boy was shot in the back from a passing vehicle as he walked down Castleton Avenue near his home in St. George yesterday afternoon, the police said. The boy was in stable condition at Staten Island Hospital after receiving five stitches in his back, according to Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman. A hospital spokesman said that the boy was ''doing very well'' and that his injury was not life-threatening. The bullet, which was fired from a vehicle traveling west on Castleton Avenue, went through the boy's body and out his chest, Sergeant O'Donnell said. The boy, who was not identified by the police because he is a minor and a crime victim, fell to the street in front of 9 Castleton Avenue, between Jersey Street and Pine Street, at 4:18 P.M. Witnesses gave conflicting reports on the vehicle. Some said it was a pickup truck with two occupants. Others said it was a brown van with tinted windows. Sergeant O'Donnell said that there was no apparent motive for the shooting and that no weapon had been recovered.
Long before any other player left this afternoon's pre-game skate, Eric Fichaud grabbed his goalie sticks and headed for the dressing room, eager to look around the new Molson Center. The day was going far too quickly as far as the 21-year-old Islanders goaltender was concerned. Having grown up a bus ride away from the old Montreal  Forum, today he was experiencing one of those homecomings that happen every so often in sports. This is a dream come true; there's no doubt," Fichaud said. "When I was younger, it was my dream to play for the Montreal Canadiens. Now I'm with the other guys, so it's my dream to beat them." But Fichaud, playing in front of his parents for the first time as a professional, soon found out that many similar dreams have died in the city acclaimed as hockey's mecca. Montreal skated to a 4-1 victory over the Islanders in a somewhat uninspired  affair that saw New York lose its sixth game in a row. Mark Recchi, Turner Stevenson, Craig Rivet and Vincent Damphousse scored for  the Canadiens. Travis Green's 21st goal of the year was New York's lone marker. The Canadiens' Jocelyn Thibault faced 28 shots, while Fichaud contended with  31. The Islanders saw their record fall to 20-44-8, last in the Atlantic Division. "I don't think it was Fichaud's best effort tonight," Coach Mike Milbury said. "The first goal was particularly bad, but then we didn't do a lot to support him through the rest of the game." Fichaud, who requested 16 tickets for family and friends, said he was going to remain positive, despite the disappointing loss. "We are a pretty young team and they are fighting for a playoff spot," he said. "Every loss is tough, but just being in a game like tonight is a great experience." Less than a minute in, the Canadiens tested the young goaltender. Damphousse  took a drop pass and fired a slap shot that rang off the post. And for a while -- albeit, a short while -- it looked as if Fichaud might prevail over his longtime friend, Thibault. After a half period that saw good scoring chances at both ends, the Islanders jumped on the scoreboard when Zigmund Palffy circled the net and slipped a pass  out to Green, who feathered a shot over the horizontal Montreal goalie. But the Canadiens quickly tied the game on Recchi's goal, and took the lead a minute into the second period on Stevenson's solo effort. HOCKEY
LEAD: To the Editor: To the Editor: "Worse Than a Blunder: a Crime" (editorial, Feb. 9), on the Iran-contra arms affair, points out that United States law forbids arms shipments to a state that sponsors terrorism -- such as Iran. True, but why stop there?  My dictionary defines terrorism as "the use of terror, violence or intimidation to achieve an end." Ample evidence from Nicaragua indicates that the contras do just that. As a former contra leader, Edgar Chamorro, acknowledged (letter, Jan. 9, 1986), "during my four years as a contra director, it was premeditated policy to terrorize civilian noncombatants to prevent them from cooperating with the government." He continued: "Hundreds of civilian murders, mutilations, tortures and rapes were committed in pursuit of this policy, of which the contra leaders and their C.I.A. superiors were well aware." An Americas Watch report (news story, Feb. 10) confirms that contra brutality continues unabated. The dictionary definition of terrorism doesn't ask whether the perpetrators are Islamic fundamentalists or anti-Communist "freedom fighters"; it doesn't ask whether the victims are American tourists or Nicaraguan peasants.  Premeditated violence against civilians, whatever its alleged justification, is called by its true name. So you are absolutely right that the Iran-contra arms shipments are more than a blunder; they are a crime.  But the crime is not just that zealots in the White House carried out their Nicaragua policy behind the backs of Congress.  The crime is the policy itself.  As long as the U.S. continues to finance and direct the contra war, then simple honesty requires us to acknowledge that our own country is, like Iran, a state that sponsors terrorism.

Except for a few slip-ups, the Giants dominated the Bears today. But those slip-ups were costly. One allowed the Bears to score on a 75-yard pass play; another let them score on a cleverly conceived 42-yard fake bootleg, and another spoiled a 35-yard Giants field-goal attempt with 15 seconds left that would have tied the score. So on a 92-degree afternoon, the Giants fell short and the Bears eked out a 20-17 victory over the Super Bowl champions. It was a well-played game that proved the Bears are still a team to reckon with and the Giants are still inconsistent on offense. The loss dropped the Giants' record to 1-2. It is their first losing record since 1987, the season after they won Super Bowl XXI. A vocal sellout crowd of 64,829 at Soldier Field watched the Bears improve their record to 3-0. The first big play by the Bears was the touchdown pass from Jim Harbaugh to Wendell Davis. The second was a run by Neal Anderson, who had been bottled up for the first 53 minutes of the game. Despite that, the Giants had a chance at the end to win the game, or at least to send it into overtime. With 3 minutes 27 seconds remaining, they took over on their 11-yard line and drove to the Bears' 8 before being pushed back to the 18. On fourth down, with 15 seconds remaining, Matt Bahr tried a field goal. His field goals won last season's conference championship and Super Bowl XXV and this year's regular-season opener. This time, the drama ended badly for the Giants. On opposing field-goal attempts, the Bears usually get a strong push up the middle from their big defenders. They got one this time from the biggest, William (the Refrigerator) Perry. "We pushed them back," Perry said of the play. "I got my hand up and blocked it." "I heard the hit," Bahr said. "It sounded solid, and even with that it almost got to the goal posts." 360-Pound Obstacle Because the kick crossed the line of scrimmage, the National Football League will recognize the play as a deflection and not a block. Semantics aside, it was a triumph for the 6-foot-2-inch Perry, who at 360 pounds is overweight even for him. As Mike Ditka, the Bears' coach, said with mixed affection and sarcasm: "He's the tallest guy on the team, you know. It hit him right in the stomach." It hit the Giants in the stomach too. "As I've said in the past," Bahr said, "the emotional excitement of making a kick is nowhere near the anguish of missing one." The Giants had a big edge in time of possession with 37 minutes 9 seconds to 22 minutes 51 seconds. They led the Bears in first downs (21 to 10), offensive plays (70 to 44) and rushing yardage (132 to 101). With all that, the Giants allowed the Bears to build a 13-0 lead at halftime. In the last 65 seconds of the half, the Giants missed a field goal and the Bears scored a touchdown and a field goal. First, Bahr was wide right on a 43-yard field-goal attempt. The Bears took over on their 25 and called for a safe pass to Brad Muster or James Thornton. Davis ran a fly pattern down the right sideline to clear out defenders across the middle. When Muster and Thorton were covered, Harbaugh saw Davis get a step on Mark Collins, the Giants' excellent cornerback. Harbaugh hit Davis in stride for the touchdown. On the ensuing kickoff, Dave Meggett of the Giants fumbled and Glen Kozlowski recovered for the Bears on the Giants' 22. Seven plays later, Kevin Butler kicked a 20-yard field goal as the half ended. In the third quarter, the Giants came alive. It started when Gary Reasons stripped the ball from Anderson and Collins recovered for the Giants. Four plays later, Bahr kicked a 35-yard field goal. Two minutes later, Collins intercepted a pass, and the Giants were on the Bears' 20. On third down from the 1, Ottis Anderson rammed over right guard, and Richard Dent stopped him for no gain. On fourth down, Anderson smacked into the same hole, and Dante Jones and Tim Ryan stopped him a foot from the goal line. "On fourth down," Handley said, "we missed a block on the backside or it would have been a walk-in touchdown." Later in the third quarter, the stiff wind contributed to 24-yard and 28-yard punts by Maury Buford of the Bears. The Giants turned both into short touchdown drives, with Rodney Hampton scoring from the 6-yard line and then the 3. So with little more than 10 minutes left in the game, the Giants led, 17-13. Then the Bears drove to the Giants' 42 and unveiled a deceptive play. Several times before, Harbaugh had run a bootleg to the right. Now he faked a bootleg and slipped the ball to Neal Anderson, who sprinted to the left and found open land. Anderson raced down the sideline. Perry Williams leaped at him, and the officials on the field decided he had pushed Anderson out of bounds on the Giants' 5. Anderson kept running to the end zone, and the replay official ruled that he had never been out of bounds and thus had scored a touchdown. "That touchdown broke our back," said Everson Walls, the Giants' defensive back.  PRO FOOTBALL

The former accountant for A. R. Baron & Company is being sued for $77 million for failing to uncover a stock-fraud scheme at the defunct brokerage firm. BDO Seidman L.L.P. was A. R. Baron's accountant from 1992 to 1996, when the brokerage firm closed. The 40-page complaint was filed on Friday in Federal court in Manhattan by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation and the A. R. Baron trustee, James Giddens. Both are managing A. R. Baron's liquidation in bankruptcy court. BDO Seidman, based in New York, joins a growing number of accountants being sued for a brokerage firm's failure. On March 5, Arthur Andersen was ordered to pay creditors of the DeLorean Motor Company as much as $112 million for failing to uncover illegal accounting practices. Also, Arthur Andersen and Mahoney Cohen & Company were sued last week for their reported role in the collapse of Bennett Funding Group Inc. BDO Seidman was paid more than $267,000 by A. R. Baron, for which it failed in its duties, the lawsuit said. Officials at BDO Seidman declined to comment, saying they had not seen the lawsuit.
The United Nations Security Council unanimously voted in favor of a resolution strengthening the enforcement of penalties -- including the freezing of funds, an arms embargo and travel prohibitions -- against Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and their associates. It also called on governments to submit updated reports on their efforts.
When a woman grows old, her limbs become brittle, her elbows show knots and her hair thins. But this does not mean she should be hauled off to the woodshed. The oldest grandmother in Queens lives behind the Kingsland Homestead on 37th Avenue. Like so many in Flushing, she is an immigrant, having come to America in 1847. She is a big, stocky Belgian, more than 60 feet high, 85 feet wide and 14 feet in circumference. Her name is Fagus sylvatica, more commonly known as the weeping European beech tree. Some one million weeping European beech trees around the world, Queens historians said, have their genetic origins from the Belgian grandmother in Queens. Her neighbors planned a party on Saturday for the venerable tree -- only one of two living landmarks in New York -- to celebrate her sesquicentennial. The other living landmark is the Magnolia Grandiflora in Bedford-Stuyvesant. ''Longfellow wrote about the village chestnut tree, but no one ever wrote about the weeping beech,'' said Byron Saunders, executive director of the Queens Historical Society. ''We thought the weeping beech should at least have a party.'' Her blood is blue. The original beech was owned by the Baron de Mare of Beersel, Belgium. A four-inch cutting was brought to America by Samuel Bowne Parsons, a Flushing horticulturist who was in Europe collecting plant specimens. ''She is a beautiful old girl,''said Shameer Bahdi, a neighbor who sleeps in the refracted moonlight that pours into his bedroom window through the weeping beech's branches. The old girl almost died two years ago, when the winter tore into her like a bear claw. Two large branches snapped off and it looked as though she would topple over. But the Parks Department's tree surgeon put pins and wires through her joints. she is expected to last a few more years. She made it to her birthday, and the Belgian Counsel General, Luk Darras, will take a cutting back to Europe. CHARLIE LeDUFF NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLUSHING

Imagine Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens and Kerry Wood facing the Bad News Bears. That is how it seems when the United States softball team plays in the Olympics. In their first four games here, the United States pitchers have thrown four shutouts and three one-hitters. In 25 innings, opposing teams have 29 strikeouts, 6 singles and 4 walks. If pitching wins titles, the United States should win the gold medal for the third Olympics in a row. ''I can't really say we've ever had a weak pitching staff,'' said Lori Harrigan, who pitched all seven innings of Tuesday's 4-0 victory over China. ''Of all the pitching staffs we've had, I don't think I can say this is the best or the worst.'' Statistically, of course, it is impossible to have a better earned run average than this team. The glamorous Jennie Finch gets most of the attention, but she leads a deep staff that includes Harrigan; Lisa Fernandez, an experienced right-hander; and Cat Osterman, a 21-year-old left-hander. Not every victory has been easy. The first two games ended early when the mercy rule -- a seven-run lead after five innings -- took effect. The third game, against Japan, was scoreless until the United States scored three runs in the eighth inning. On Tuesday, China's leadoff hitter reached on a single, and Harrigan allowed no hits the rest of the way. ''The key to the U.S. team is you have to keep the runs close,'' the China coach, Shan McDonald, said. ''You're not going to score that many runs off them, even on your best day.'' Softball was introduced as an Olympic sport in 1996, and in winning the gold medal in Atlanta and in Sydney, Australia, the United States won 15 of 19 games. Three teams beat the United States in 2000 -- Australia, Japan and China -- but the Americans have already beaten each of them in Athens. Finch, who threw three no-hit innings in the opening game against Italy, said that any team could beat the United States at any time. But the college system that feeds the national team, and an extensive pre-Olympic tour, gives the United States a distinct advantage. ''In the U.S., there are more opportunities to develop players from the age of 8, 9 or 10 years old,'' McDonald said. ''From college to the Olympic level, with endorsements, it can become more of a career. There's very good coaching in the U.S., very good instruction.'' The pitchers also have, in the parlance of major leaguers, filthy stuff. Finch throws about 66 miles an hour from 43 feet, roughly the equivalent of 95 m.p.h. from the 60 feet 6 inches in baseball. Coach Mike Candrea said that each pitcher could throw a pitch that rises, one that drops, an off-speed pitch, a screwball and a curveball. ''That's what our staff tries to do, have a lot of pitches to work with,'' said catcher Jenny Topping, who went 2 for 2 with a triple on Tuesday. ''It makes it enjoyable to call a pitch and know it's going to move and go where you want it to go.'' The United States can also hit, outscoring its opponents by 24-0 in the four games. The United States hitters are probably the best in the world; apparently, they are the only ones who can touch the American pitching staff. ''I think one of the things we have on our side is we don't have to face our team,'' Harrigan said. ''We face our team in intrasquad scrimmages, and they hit us all year.'' SUMMER 2004 GAMES -- SOFTBALL: PRELIMINARY ROUND
To the Editor: The surprise election victory for Spain's Socialists on Sunday (front page, March 15) will no doubt worry Tony Blair and President Bush. Despite Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's solid economic performance, his highly unpopular involvement of Spain in Iraq may have been the catalyst for change after the terror attacks of March 11. The Spanish people have sent a clear message to leaders like Tony Blair, Silvio Berlusconi of Italy and George W. Bush: far from eradicating and protecting us from terrorism, their insensitive actions have in many ways brought the likelihood of Islamic terrorist attacks a step closer. By practically abandoning Middle East peace initiatives and invading Iraq without a clear mandate, they have incurred an elevated level of anger from the Muslim world, which is feeling increasingly isolated.

Rubber Plants or Shrubs? Q. I have a rubber plant, an old friend with nine lives, which has new growth starting about halfway up the stem. From the base there is a one-and-a-half foot shoot growing out. Should I cut it off? A. One of the nice things about the rubber plant, Ficus elastica, is that there are very few ''shoulds'' involved. The only two that really matter are ''water sparingly'' and ''don't overfertilize.'' Outdoors, rubber plants can become 60-foot trees, with multiple trunks that make them look like miniature forests. Indoors, size is limited mostly by the size of the container, the light available and the determination of the owner. If you remove the new shoot, you will maintain the columnar form you have become used to. If you leave it, and any more that follow, the plant will start bushing out. To make more branches on the  stem, shoot or both, prune right above any leaf node or above the scar where a leaf used to be. The plant will branch at the cut but may not do so evenly (rubber plants are famous for lopsided extensions). You might have to prune several times over the course of a year or so before you get a balanced plant. Use a very sharp knife. Wear gloves. Protect the work surface. And have some rooting hormone like Rootone or some wood ashes handy, to help seal the cut. The white sap of the rubber plant doesn't make the best quality tires -- for that you'd want the true rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis -- but it is still copious, very sticky and hard to remove. Putting Lupines On View Q. Last year, we bought a summer house in New Hampshire. There is a beautiful bed of lupines in back of the old barn. I would like to move them around to the front so we can enjoy them from the house. But when I mentioned this to our new neighbor, she said they cannot be transplanted. Is she right? A. Probably. Lupines quickly form deep taproots, so they can be moved around only when they are very young. Once they are well established, that's it. If you want a big bed of lupines in front of the barn, your best bet is to start them from seed. Prepare the soil as soon as the ground can be worked, adding sand if it is heavy -- lupines demand good drainage -- and working in a bit of compost or well-composted manure. (The plants out back may well be enjoying the ancient stable sweepings.) Lupine seeds have very hard coats, which can slow germination, so nick them on the side with a sharp knife or razor blade before planting. Keep the soil moist but not wet until they sprout, then just weed and thin if necessary. If the front of the barn is in full sun but not baking hot, the plants should grow quickly this year and bloom lavishly in the early summer of 2003. Lupine seeds are sold by Fedco Trees, Box 520-A, Waterville, Me. 04903, (207) 873-7333; and by Pinetree Garden Seeds, Box 300, New Gloucester, Me. 04260, (207) 926-3400. Both catalogs are free.

A body was discovered inside a car that burned yesterday morning in the parking lot of the World's Fair Marina in Flushing Bay, the police said. The lot is known to be a lover's lane for both gay and straight couples and a rest stop for cab and limousine drivers waiting to pick up passengers at nearby La Guardia Airport, according to people who work in the area. Witnesses who saw the car in flames called 911 just before 6 a.m., fire officials said. Later, witnesses described the car as a white Toyota Celica without a front license plate and said the body inside was burned to a skeleton. The police said yesterday that they were trying to identify the owner of the vehicle and the cause of the fire. EMILY VASQUEZ (NYT)
Contrary to stereotype, a new video game will encourage players to go outside and play in the sunshine. In fact, natural light is a potent weapon in the game against tiny vampires and other digital bad guys. Boktai: The Sun Is in Your Hand, will work with both the Game Boy Advance and the Game Boy Advance SP. The cartridge, which plugs into the device, incorporates a solar sensor; the sunlight it absorbs can help a player win the game. Boktai revolves around the exploits of Django, a vampire hunter who uses light to destroy the hungry undead. The amount of sunlight he is able to collect determines the extent to which he is able to carry out his mission. The game was developed by Hideo Kojima, the creator of Metal Gear Solid. It is scheduled for release this fall and is expected to cost $30. Geoff Mulligan, a Konami executive, called its design ''a watershed moment.'' No other video game is known to use natural light in such a way. Michel Marriott NEWS WATCH: VIDEO GAMES
IT is all about relativity in the National Football League, a week-to-week proposition, the ongoing search for someone in a more vulnerable position than yourself. All things considered yesterday, Danny Kanell could have been Ryan Leaf. He could have been faced with the burden of grand, second-pick-of-the-draft expectations, along with a persistent pass rush in front of opportunistic defensive backs. He could have set himself up for ridicule the previous week by publicly conducting himself like a jerk. He could have thrown four interceptions and wound up being benched for someone named Craig Whelihan, a development that drew a convulsive roar from the home-team crowd. Kanell, conversely, had one of those games when he plays well enough, shows just enough, to make people believe the Giants can dream on with him as the starter. Relative to Leaf, Kanell was the epitome of poise and experience as the Giants defeated the San Diego Chargers, 34-16, at Qualcomm Stadium by utilizing their, in Kanell's words, ''formula for success.'' Just six days after doomsday at home versus Dallas, a turnover-inducing defense plus 313 yards of adequate, balanced offense equaled a 2-2 record and a share of first place in the extremely forgiving N.F.C. East. As we said, this is week-to-week, particularly in the case of a Giants offense that features Kanell. It is going to be a while, if ever, before he isn't considered as good as his last series of downs. What we can definitively say about Kanell is that he has thrown no obscenity-laced tirades with inquisitive reporters, or footballs at their heads, which Leaf was known for in college. This is what passed for football talk here, following two rookie run-ins last week by Leaf with local sports journalists, the first of which produced apologies by Leaf and the Chargers. Somehow, after three professional games, Leaf had managed to estrange himself from a typically docile audience that had welcomed him to town as the quarterback who would be king. ''The expectations are almost impossible for him to live up to,'' said Kanell, one young quarterback empathizing with another. ''I know everything he's going through.'' Actually, Leaf's double-edged sword is one Kanell has not had to juggle, under Jim Fassel's protective cocoon. No one, least of all his coach, has demanded eminence from this 1996 fourth-round draft pick who last season made everyone happy by simply relieving Dave Brown, the Giants' own failed quarterback savior. ''Manage the game,'' became Fassel's mantra regarding Kanell, one he has, at times, carried a bit too far. The Giants, who had said they were determined to come in here and establish a running game for the first time this season, more or less abandoned that line after their opening three-and-out series. Next time out, Kanell threw the ball, incomplete, on first down, but proceeded to drive the Giants 70 yards for a touchdown. Of particular note, he completed three third-down passes for first downs, two of them for a combined 36 yards to the slippery Ike Hilliard. By the middle of the second quarter, Kanell had hit Chris Calloway for a 25-yard touchdown and driven the Giants 61 yards for another touchdown and a 21-0 lead. Leaf, meanwhile, had thrown interceptions on three straight possessions, the last two setting up the Giants' second and third touchdowns. One came in the teeth of a ferocious rush. Another ball was tipped at the line of scrimmage. The Chargers, two season-opening victories notwithstanding, are not very good. But then, cocky young quarterbacks with big-money contracts are supposed to work magic. Instead, Leaf permanently took his team out of the game, telegraphing a third-quarter pass across the middle that the Giants' free safety, Percy Ellsworth, picked off and returned 20 yards for a touchdown. That was enough for the Chargers' head coach, Kevin Gilbride, who summoned Whelihan from the bullpen. The fans cheered, louder when Whelihan threw a touchdown on his first series. Later, they booed a commercial with Leaf on the large viewer screen. Then they booed Leaf's public service announcement during the fourth quarter, by which time he was on the sideline being consoled by an offensive guard named Aaron Taylor. ''Ryan's learned a lot this last week,'' Taylor said. ''I think he's ready to accept responsibility and go forward.'' He was, at least, ready to seek a more humble place than he did last week, when he completed one pass for 4 yards against Kansas City, and didn't want to hear about it. ''It kind of feels like somebody rips your heart out of your chest,'' he said. ''I wanted to succeed so much and then I went out and lost the game.'' He was sad-eyed, contrite. ''You've got to look at yourself and kind of wonder if you're good enough to play at this level,'' he said. Leaf is a strapping kid, 6 feet 5 inches, who did throw some very good balls. Peyton Manning has not exactly torn up the league either. It is very early and maybe this embarrassment was a good, hard lesson that will lead Leaf to a better place. Kanell was much better yesterday, but don't make the Giants answer the question of whether they would trade Kanell for Leaf, attitude and all. They know nice guys don't necessarily finish first in the end.
A front-page article on Wednesday about the election of Cory Booker as mayor of Newark gave erroneous results in some copies for the Municipal Council races. (The error also appeared in a related article in some copies about the Council races.) Two of Mr. Booker's handpicked candidates, not three, won outright. (A third, Ronald C. Rice, will face Mamie Bridgeforth in a runoff on June 13.)

It's enough to give a lady a headache -- and a lot of tourists heat exhaustion. Crowds wanting to climb to the crown of the Statue of Liberty have become so large in recent summers that the National Park Service has restricted access to the crown -- 22 stories up -- to passengers on the first ferries of the day from Battery Park in Manhattan and Liberty State Park in Jersey City. Both of those ferries leave at 8:30 A.M., and visitors who want to be on them should arrive at the ferry terminals by 7:30 A.M. The restrictions, which took effect on Monday, were imposed to reduce the lines in the statue's stairwell, where summer temperatures can exceed 100 degrees. The heat, combined with a wait of up to three hours, caused 160 visitors to be treated for heat-related illness last July and August. Under the new restrictions, all visitors on the first two ferries receive passes allowing them to get in line for the 354-step climb to the diadem until noon, when access is cut off. Everyone else will still be able to enjoy the view from the top of the statue's pedestal -- and will have more time to do so. Liberty Island will stay open an extra two hours a day, with the first ferries leaving an hour earlier than the usual 9:30 departure and the last ferries leaving the island at 7 P.M. instead of 6 P.M. The new restrictions are in effect through Labor Day. For ferry information, call (212) 269-5755. TRAVEL ADVISORY
LEAD: Final rules for random drug testing of Government employees ranging from the White House chief of staff to secretaries were presented to Congress today by Federal agencies. Final rules for random drug testing of Government employees ranging from the White House chief of staff to secretaries were presented to Congress today by Federal agencies. The plans brought an immediate threat of legal action from a group of Justice Department lawyers. Plans of several other agencies have already been blocked by court suits. The agencies disclosed details of their plans after reviews by the Department of Health and Human Services. Congress specified that the department review each plan for adherence to technical testing guidelines and certify them to Congress before money could be spent to carry out President Reagan's 1986 executive order for expanded drug testing.
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday as the bond market gave back much of its earlier gains after a Government report showed a sharp drop in June new-home sales because of higher interest rates. Bonds were given a lift from a stronger dollar amid optimisim that talks between the United States and Japan would produce a compromise to avert a potential trade war. The price of the 30-year bond slipped 3/32 , to 8611/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 7.40 percent, from 7.39 percent on Monday. The yield on a two-year note dropped 2 basis points, to 5.97 percent, while the yield on a seven-year note fell a basis point, to 6.88 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. New-Home Sales Decline The Commerce Department reported yesterday that sales of new homes fell 14.1 percent in June, which was weaker than expected. Home sales are typically the first area of economic activity to be slowed by higher interest rates, said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh. "While housing might have contributed heavily to past economic growth, from here forward those contributions will be smaller and will not give the boost to the economy going forward as it has in the past year," Mr. Hoffman said. As a result, he sees economic growth slowing to 2.5 percent, from nearly 3.5 percent in the last two quarters. "Hints are now appearing that growth is cooling," he said. Analysts said it was important to keep in mind not only the volatility of the homes sales data, but also the tendency for the Government to make sharp revisions to past data.  Many analysts said that the June report almost certainly overstated the degree of weakness in housing.  Many analysts expect that the Fed will weigh tomorrow's retail sales report and Friday's employment report and may tighten credit on Aug. 16, after the Fed's policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets. Some expect a rise in short-term rates of about a half-point depending on the strength of the employment and retail reports for July. Mr. Hoffman said he expected that the Fed would raise rates again, but with a gentle touch. Elsewhere, investors in the municipal bond market found the New York State Thruway Authority's $375 million negotiated sale of revenue bonds attractive enough to cause orders to outstrip the amount of bonds available for sale and in some cases lower the bond yields about 5 basis points. Underwriters led by Smith Barney Inc. repriced the shorter-maturity serial bonds to yield from 3.75 percent for an issue due in 1995 to 5.95 percent in 2011. For longer maturities, a bond due in 2014 was priced to yield 6.15 percent. The financing, except for the triple-A rated insured securities which run from 2000 through 2011, is rated A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. In the corporate bond market, Sears, Roebuck & Company was busy selling $783.5 million of global bonds backed by credit cards, in two parts. In the first part, underwriters led by CS First Boston priced $750 million of senior securities with an average life of five years at $998.44 for every $1,000 of debt, to yield 7.141 percent, or about 43 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. The remaining $33.5 million of subordinated securities with average life of 6.1 years was priced at $998.13 for every $1,000 of debt to yield 7.40 percent, or about 60 basis points more than a Treasury with a comparable maturity. Traders said the senior debt was rated triple-A by Moody's and S.& P., while the subordinated debt was rated A1 by Moody's and A by S.& P.  CREDIT MARKETS

IT has, as Men's Health magazine points out, become a staple of the advice offered by financial self-help books and experts: If you want to save more money, skip that $4 coffee you have every day. Compounded at 8 percent interest annually, that small sacrifice will be worth north of $70,000 in 20 years. ''Fine, but what about this,'' Anya Kamenetz writes. ''You like latte. If you were to apply their advice to every aspect of your life, you'd live at the Y, hitchhike to work, and eat three squares of white bread a day. Their advice may help you save, but it won't help you live.'' The writer's alternative: we all have spending strengths and weakness and so the secret to financial success is that we need to ''learn how to exploit the former while suppressing the latter.'' Ms. Kamenetz writes that spenders can be placed in one of three categories: sleepwalkers, who simply do not pay attention to how much they are spending; status spenders, who buy things to impress others; or scrimpers, and even they have problems, she says. They may occasionally binge to offset all the self-sacrifice or find it hard to ''part with a large chuck of change even when it's a wise investment,'' or both. The magazine offers a series of tips for each group. For example, sleepwalkers need to pay their bills online, to make sure they are paid on time; status seekers should write all their checks by hand, to be painfully aware of each expenditure; and scrimpers should set a budget that includes a reasonable amount of spending. WHO ARE YOU? -- It is fine to have a financial plan devised by others. But if you are going to stick to it, you need to understand why you spend (and save) the way you do, Essence argues in its current issue. To help you find out, the magazine provides a quiz to help you determine why you deal with money the way you do. Sample question: You just got a promotion with a 5 percent raise. The first thing you do is: A) Buy the same Louis Vuitton bag your boss has B) Increase your 401(k) contribution by 1 percent C) Bank the raise in a savings account D) Do nothing. ''It's only 5 percent what difference will it make?'' If you answer ''a'' you are a ''classic spender,'' who buys on impulse, often on credit, and need to think about the long-term consequences before you spend. ''B'' means that saving is important to you, ''but you may be big on head knowledge and low on action.'' You could save more. Those who pick ''c'' are too cautious. ''You may need to learn how to take calculated risks.'' If you answered ''d,'' it means you want someone else to tell you what to do, and you need to get more involved in your financial life. DIGITAL PRINTS -- Even if all you know about police procedures comes from watching television, you know that the authorities can identify a gun used in a crime by the unique marks it leaves on a bullet. The same thing is true with digital cameras and the prints they produce. ''Software developed by Jessica Fridrich at the State University of New York in Binghamton exploits the fact that every digital camera introduces a unique pattern of imperfections, or 'noise,' into its images,'' Kate Greene writes in Technology Review. Ms. Fridrich's software determines the camera's noise signature by identifying the irregularities in the pictures it produces, and that ''yields a 'fingerprint' that investigators can search for in other photos.'' Among other things, the software is viewed as an important advance in the battle against child pornography. FINAL TAKE -- Women's Health reminds us that it was 10 years ago today that Taco Bell ran full-page ads claiming that it had purchased the Liberty Bell to help pay off the national debt. The announcement was treated seriously in ''hundreds of print and broadcast outlets.'' Happy April Fool's day. PAUL B. BROWN WHAT'S OFFLINE
In an attempt to rescue Romania's reputation from the damage caused by riots in the capital last week, Romanian leaders pledged today to keep the country on the path toward a market-style economy under a caretaker Government drawn from several political parties. Theodor Stolojan, a 48-year-old former Finance Minister named Tuesday to replace Petre Roman as Prime Minister, said at a news conference today that he would pursue the policies of Mr. Roman's Government, while making adjustments "to quiet social content." He said he would propose a new multiparty cabinet to Parliament as soon as possible to run the country until the next elections, which are expected either this fall or next spring. President Ion Iliescu met with foreign business leaders today in an attempt to reassure international financial institutions that Romania is not wavering in its commitment to either democracy or economic change after the shock of a rampage by angry coal miners last week. By bringing down the Government, the miners' violent protests had cast a shadow over the country's first painful steps toward a market economy, at a time when Romania seemed on the verge of winning back the confidence of foreign governments and international banking institutions. Fear 'We Will Be Left Alone' "Everything was going forward before the miners' riot," said Silviu Brucan, a former Government official now in retirement. "The most obnoxious effect will be that the West will turn its back on Romania, and we will be left alone to swim in poverty." As one of the poorest countries in Europe, with a population of 23 million divided by mutual suspicions, Romania can ill afford to lose foreign help. Mr. Stolojan, whose last job was head of the national privatization program, defended the hefty price increases that have been the source of widespread discontent, but indicated that wage adjustments might be made in order to offset the painful effects of the economic transition. "Our only problem," he said, "is to find a mechanism which makes the cost affordable" to the population and "to keep inflation under control."  Leader Delays Taking Office Mr. Stolojan said today that he would not take office until his Cabinet is approved by Parliament. Until then, Mr. Roman will remain in his job, he said. One of the first victims of last week's rioting was a $300 million loan from the World Bank, timed to help cushion the shock of a new currency system that was to have taken effect Sept. 28. A member of the World Bank team here to negotiate the loan was hurt during a melee between the miners and security forces, and now both the loan and the currency reform have been put on hold, said Mugur Isarescu, governor of Romania's Central Bank. "There is not only a real risk but a high probability that Romania's credit has been damaged dramatically," he said. Also hanging in the balance are loans from European Community and the lifting of tariff barriers by the United States, Mr. Isarescu noted.  Miners' Changing Image The last time the miners descended on Bucharest in June 1990, they came to the defense of Mr. Iliescu, a survivor of the old Communist Government who was then fresh from victory in Romania's first post-Communist elections. The image of miners going after anti-Government demonstrators with clubs and truncheons shocked the world. Since then, the political kaleidoscope here has shifted, offering a new and bewildering array of forces. A student leader who had been beaten by the miners during their last rampage stood by their side last week, as together they called for Mr. Roman's downfall. The National Peasants Party, an opposition party that 15 months ago bore the brunt of the miners' rage, gave the miners' leaders a standing ovation at a party congress this weekend. As they swarmed through Parliament, the miners themselves shouted "Down with Communism!" as they called for greater job security and higher wages. "They were shouting anti-Communist slogans, but all their demands were Communist-style demands," said Mr. Isarescu, who noted that the miners attacked privately held shops, one of the few symptoms of Romania's fledgling market system.
Andy Roddick was stretched out in the air today, dangling from an imaginary clothesline over the worn grass, desperate to reach the one volley that could change the glum mood of the American men. He took a stab at the ball. As he crashed to the court in a belly flop, he watched as the ball pecked the net tape and plopped into the court for a winner. All at once, he earned his grass stains and pried a roar out of a Wimbledon crowd that had been waving the Union Jack for their pseudo countryman, Greg Rusedski. Finally, Roddick had produced his first break point of the match in the fifth game of the third set. But he botched the encore. On the next point, Roddick ripped a backhand into the bottom of the net. Temporary elation had given way to lingering disbelief. As Roddick is learning on his second lap around the Tour, replicating greatness is not a given; confirming an arrival is tricky business. With Rusedski throwing lawn darts for serves, and Roddick without a backhand he could trust, the 11th-seeded Roddick exited in the third round after a troubling 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 loss. ''I have a lot of work to do,'' said Roddick, who had not been beaten in straight sets at a major. ''I don't know if there's just one magical thing that's going to turn it around.'' Until he conjures up an answer, there may be some lag time between the next dominating American and Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, two fading stars. On an unimaginable draw sheet, the gap between the American past and future is left in the hands of Jeff Morrison, who lost in qualifying but gained entry to the tournament when Tommy Haas withdrew. If the 98th-ranked unknown out of West Virginia cannot come up with a victory in his third-round match against 18th-seeded Sjeng Schalken on Saturday, the United States will not be represented in the men's Round of 16 at Wimbledon for the first time since the Open Era began in 1968. ''It's surprising, but I don't know how it affects the overall state of American tennis,'' Roddick said. ''I still think that it's pretty good.'' Only as it relates to the American women. They fulfilled their duties today as Serena Williams, Jennifer Capriati, Chanda Rubin and even Laura Granville advanced to the fourth round. Williams and Capriati were natural picks, with Rubin not a bad guess. But the 134th-ranked Granville, the pride of Stanford, has emerged out of qualifying anonymity, advancing on the wings of her 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 upset of Mary Pierce. Pierce would have had a chance to serve out the match in the second set if she had converted a break point on Granville's serve. Granville was so irritated at herself for falling into this predicament, she managed to channel that anger into an aggressive approach that overwhelmed Pierce. ''Playing Mary Pierce, it almost didn't feel real,'' said Granville, who entered Wimbledon with an 0-2 Tour record. ''I can't really describe it.'' And yet, Granville is just one of the many remaining players at Wimbledon who require two forms of identification for entry. Few players look familiar at first glance, particularly on the men's side. This is the land of misfits and castoffs. Two previously vanished stars -- unseeded Mark Philippoussis and Richard Krajicek -- have resurfaced; both won today. The temperamental talent from Belgium, Xavier Malisse, doused fifth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov, leaving the bottom half of the draw without a player in the top 20. And two erratic lefties, Wayne Arthurs and Rusedski, found revenge against the marketed young stars of the new era by advancing. Arthurs, an Australian, simply had more power than Taylor Dent, the laid-back Californian with the 140-mile-an-hour serve. Unable to break the uncanny serve of Arthurs, Dent could not come up with the critical points in three of the four tie breakers, losing by 7-6 (2), 7-6 (3), 6-7 (4), 7-6 (5). ''That's my first where it's been all tie breakers,'' said Dent, who had 13 aces to Arthurs's 32. ''I think a loss is a loss. If I go out there and lose 0, 0 and 0 or if it's four tie breakers, it's frustrating both ways. But I can walk off the court and say he had to play that good to beat me, and that's a good feeling.'' Roddick did not exit with such positive vibes. A year ago, at age 18, he was the up-and-comer who was gaining on stardom with every entry into a major. This year, he bowed out at the Australian Open with an ankle injury and lost in the first round to Arthurs at the French Open. Today, he was not equipped to handle a very sharp Rusedski, the Canadian-born serve-and-volley player who conveniently switched citizenship. More than Roddick's inability to return Rusedski's serve, or his trouble finding a rhythm on his backhand passing shots, he failed to put pressure on his opponent by losing his own serve. He chastised himself, contorted his face and kicked the green out of the grass, but nothing seemed to right his slide. ''I was trying to get myself in the match,'' Roddick said. ''I was on the outside looking in.'' He has been in a similar location at different times this year, struggling against some of the same players he put away last year. On his second time around, opponents know him better, but those who have watched him play at close range do not see any reason to panic. ''There's a learning curve,'' said Jim Courier, who has helped guide Roddick as an assistant coach on the Davis Cup team. ''Last year was gravy. He's a marked man for the first time. There is no sense of desperation to win a slam to solidify his place on the Tour. It's a matter of when, not if.'' MATCH POINTS Eleventh-seeded DANIELA HANTUCHOVA of Slovakia moved on to the fourth round after her 6-4, 6-4 victory against MAJA MATEVZIC of Slovenia. . . . Fame was fleeting for the band of second-round upset kings. GEORGE BASTL, who took out PETE SAMPRAS, lost in straight sets, as did PARADORN SRICHAPHAN, who upset ANDRE AGASSI. After ending MARAT SAFIN's Wimbledon run, OLIVIER ROCHUS was defeated by ARNAUD CLEMENT in straight sets. TENNIS

KOLBE--Siegfried, died on January 19th of heart disease, in Berlin, age 46. A brilliant architect who worked in New York at Kohn, Pedersen and Fox during the 1980's, this world traveller will be much missed. Memorial January 29th; 011-49-172300-4225 for details.
After eight years, four architects and an uncounted number of revisions, plans for a new office building at 250 Water Street, in the South Street Seaport Historic District, were approved yesterday by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The panel unanimously favored a 10-story structure, with an 11th-floor mechanical penthouse, on a block between Beekman Street and Peck Slip that is now occupied by a parking lot. "I'm glad to have this part of the process behind us," said Laurie Beckelman, the chairwoman of the landmarks commission. The project would be built by Milstein Properties and designed by Platt & Byard Architects, both of Manhattan. Paul and Seymour Milstein, the developers, first proposed a 28-story office building in 1983. The commission rejected it as out of scale with the low-rise historic district.

At the sound of the tone: Call me, Ishmael. With little fanfare, voice mail has spread throughout American business, if not literature. More and more people encounter voice mail, a kind of answering machine on steroids, whenever they call a travel agency, a bank, a car dealership or, especially, a co-worker down the hall. Market research indicates that 70 percent of a typical company's phone traffic is internal. Thus, the thick handbooks of voice-mail instructions are mostly designed to send a message to Harry down the hall. It seems hard to believe that like answering machines, voice mail barely existed a decade ago. What led to voice mail's ubiquity was less a revolution in telephone technology (the handset has changed little in basic principles since Alexander Graham Bell) than a drop in the cost of computing power and clever devices that convert voice into numbers. As recently as 1987, only 7,000 voice systems were sold. After this slow start, the voice-messaging business is growing quickly, with more than 38,000 systems expected to be sold this year. The North American Telecommunications Association, a trade group, estimates that sales of voice-messaging systems will exceed $1 billion by 1994, up from less than $800 million in 1990. Most of the growth appears to be in small- and medium-size systems. Voice-mail systems today vary in price from $12,000 for small systems to more than $1 million for the top of the line. The Octel Communications Corporation in Milipitas, Calif., is the largest maker of voice-mail equipment, with more than 20 percent of the market. A.T.&T., Northern Telecom of Canada and VMX of San Jose are also leading makers of equipment. Moreover, there is a substantial business in selling voice-mail services, leasing equipment to customers and charging them by the number of mailboxes. One leader in this business is Tigon, a unit of Ameritech, the Midwestern Bell operating company. Unlike answering machines, which answer specific telephones, voice-mail machines can also send and receive messages from other subscribers on the system without having to call them. Thus, a supervisor can send 12 copies of a voice message to 12 other executives, an impossibility with a mere answering machine. Other applications, like "automated attendant," are, in effect, robot switchboard and directory-assistance operators. Something called "interactive voice response" allows callers to record information for college registration, inquire about bank accounts or request travel brochures. SOME versions of telephone answering machines were invented in the 1920's and 1930's, but voice mail did not get its very limited start until the late 1970's. The story goes that an entrepreneur, Gordon Matthews, was stuck in a driving rainstorm and noticed in a nearby dump a huge pink blob of "While You Were Out" pink message slips. It occurred to him that a machine allowing people to record detailed messages in their own voices could help eliminate the blizzard of paper as well as garbled and incomplete messages. But the first machines developed by Mr. Matthews's company, which eventually became VMX Inc., did not answer the telephone. Employees could leave a message for other employees only without ringing the phone. Companies therefore had a hard time justifying the purchase. Indeed, for the early part of the 1980's, voice-mail computers were simply too big, too unreliable and too expensive to be worthwhile to most corporations. That has a lot to do with the nature of the human voice. Telephone lines carry the human voice at a transmission rate of 64,000 bits a second. With the memory of typical computer disk drives of the early 80's totaling about 200 million bits, that meant that a computer had at most about 52 minutes worth of messages. With the average employee getting about three messages a day, a moderate-size business of a few dozen employees would eat up the computer memory in a few days. The voice mail system would whir to a halt. To get around the small capacity, businesses would buy multiple units, but the probability that a flaw in one unit would slow down a nearby unit meant the system broke down as often as every month or so. To save precious disk space, and thus expand the computer's capacity, clever scientists came up with algorithms, or sophisticated mathematical recipes, that "sampled" the voice information like a pollster interviewing potential voters. When a person speaks, a voice-mail computer (and often the telephone company's own computers as well) turns the analog signal, which is proportional to changes in electrical voltage, into numbers. This computer code comprises the familiar 1's and 0's that computers use to talk to each other and allows voice-mail systems to process voices like so much electronic sausage. Clever computers can use as little as one-fourth of the incoming voice information and still produce a sound that closely resembles the original speech. What the systems lose in voice fidelity (callers often complain they sound tinny on voice-mail messages), they gain in memory and flexibility. The voice-mail machines of the early 1980's were the size of five or six refrigerators. Today, the machines are smaller than a three-drawer filing cabinet. As the computer chips that made personal computers possible grew cheaper and more reliable, so did voice-mail systems. Twenty hours of storage capacity that cost $180,000 in the early 1980's now costs about $13,000. The increased computer capacity also brought a proliferation of options designed to appeal to the widest number of customers, from pharmaceutical salesmen to real estate brokers to journalists. But more choices also meant more chances for callers to be captured in "voice-mail jail," that labyrinth of recorded voices issuing instructions from which there sometimes seems no escape short of hanging up. THESE days corporations, after prodding from voice-mail companies, are rewriting their programs so that voice-mail greetings are no longer than 10 seconds and callers do not have to listen to more than three or four choices, one of which is talking to a human operator. Moreover, Octel plans to introduce as early as next year a "univeral mail box." This all-encompassing mail drop would gather paper and electronic-mail messages as well as messages from subscribers' business, residence and cellular telephone voice mail. This consolidated mailbox could also receive electronic versions of facsimiles that could be printed out at home, or the office, or perhaps even be displayed on a hotel television screen during a business trip. "Voice mail is like music," said Tom S. Hunse, vice president of marketing for Tigon.  "Some of it's good, some of it's bad. But what are you going to do when 75 percent of the time the person you call is just not in?" IT'S JANE BARBE SETTING THE TONE You know Jane Barbe. You just may not realize it. Probably more than any other individual, she is the Voice of voice mail. More than 40 million people hear her clear, measured tones informing them that "At the tone, the time is 8:57 and 50 seconds" or "All circuits are busy now. Please try again later." And on more and more voice-mail systems, hers is the gently encouraging voice urging, "Please press 1 for more options." At all times in her telephone persona, Mrs. Barbe (pronounced BAR-bee) is friendly, easy to understand, and authoritative without being, uh, matronizing. It is something of a jolt to find that the civilian Mrs. Barbe speaks with a lilting Southern accent that can quite quickly drop into a sultry register. She worked on scrubbing the Scarlett O'Hara out of her voice while majoring in drama at the University of Georgia. "You haven't lived until you've heard 'Antigone' in a Southern accent," said Mrs. Barbe, who lives in Atlanta and has two grown children. With her husband, John, a semi-retired musician, she composed and sang commercial jingles, a discipline that required an accentless voice. When she records voice-mail announcements for Octel, the largest maker of voice-mail equipment, she does more than 1,000 sound bites at a time. This can take days and be a bit disconcerting for Mrs. Barbe. Some announcements have to be assembled out of a dozen or more separately recorded sound bites -- for example, "your message," then "was sent," then "May," then separate bites for the exact date and time of day. Yet all the bites have to sound as if they were spoken at the same time. Some scripts are rewritten because particular words do not properly "digitize" -- become converted into computer code -- or because Mrs. Barbe's pitch on certain words inadvertently triggers other computer functions. Although Mrs. Barbe could probably make a fortune from phone messages of a less corporate nature, she said she does not expect to record anything racier than the announcement she did for the Coast Guard. "They wanted to get the crew's attention if something could endanger the ship," Mrs. Barbe said. She then launches into a breathy "Foreign object floating in the water" that would stop a sailor dead in his tracks.
There had been tension all afternoon because of the unrest, complete with tear gas and sirens, in the nearby streets. There had been a bomb scare right before the game. There was the disturbing experience of having a 7-0 lead become a 7-7 nightmare. But the exhausting, unnerving night came to a close for the Mets with an 8-7 victory, a draining, dizzying triumph over the Braves, their fourth straight victory. Daryl Boston, his eighth-inning home run having climbed deeply and quietly into the night, silenced Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium for good, the noise and nonsense of a mad game buried by finality at last. "A policeman had got on our bus on the way to the game," said Boston, the outfielder who was an emergency replacement for the again-injured Vince Coleman. "He told us the Braves had 33 scoreless innings going. He told us we were all in trouble." Avery's Bad Night As it turned out, the Braves were in more scoreboard difficulty inside five innings than they had been over the last 49 innings combined. Steve Avery, the sensational left-hander who had mediocre material to work with and then terrible luck, was yanked in the fourth after the Mets had scored five runs. There were errors, mental mistakes and a truckload of singles in the inning. And an inning later, there were another couple of runs and a fat 7-0 advantage. "I don't know why, but I never felt comfortable," said Manager Jeff Torborg. "Maybe I'm not used to huge leads. All I know is I didn't feel good." He certainly was not happy with what followed. Anthony Young, who had got through five scoreless innings with his solid, steadfast ethic on the mound, gave up what looked like an inconsequential homer to Terry Pendleton in the sixth. "Up 7-1, I told the manager I wanted to go out and try the seventh," said Young. "I wanted to start it." But a single by Damon Berryhill and a fielding error by Young on Mark Lemke's grounder back to the mound undercut the sense of inevitability surrounding Young's night. Jeff Blauser's two-run double to the wall in left-center then finished any chance that Young had of completing what he started. "I thought turning it over to the relievers at that point was a reasonable request," said Young. But neither Paul Gibson nor Jeff Innis was up to the favor. Brian Hunter doubled off Gibson for the run that made the score 7-4, and then Deion Sanders walked. Torborg called upon Innis, and the right-hander quickly got the Mets within range of escape by forcing Pendleton to ground into a double play. Innis then started aggressively against Ron Gant, an 0-2 count. But Gant timed Innis's side-armed slider and smashed it off the top of the fence in left for a double and a 7-5 score. The outfield fence, though, was no obstacle to David Justice. The right fielder, with a lashing of an Innis pitch at the belt, hit a 442-foot homer for two more runs and the completion of a comeback from a 7-0 hole. "I couldn't have given them better pitches to hit if I had gone up there and dropped them in front of them," said Innis. Spirits, though, weren't sunk in the dugout. The third out of the seventh was obtained, and the score, miserable as it was, stood no worse than deadlocked. "I keep saying it, but there is a great feeling in our dugout," said Torborg. "It's not raucous. It's not phony. It's a quiet professional confidence." The dugout was indeed raucous a moment later. Boston, feasting on a pitch low in the strike zone from Juan Berenguer, crashed a two-out solo shot to the bleachers in right. "It means a lot that we didn't fold," said Torborg. "That would have been an easy El Foldo after giving up a 7-0 lead and being in their ball park." But there was no folding, no remaining drama. Tim Burke, making his first appearance on the mound since April 15, worked a scoreless eighth, and John Franco gained his fifth save. INSIDE PITCH Atlanta Mayor MAYNARD JACKSON said he had considered postponing Friday night's game because of the civil disorder, but went ahead and allowed it. The bomb threat did not require the evacuation of the stadium and resulted in nothing. VINCE COLEMAN, activated from the disabled list after missing nearly a month because of a damaged left hamstring, lasted all of one inning in his return. The left fielder injured a muscle in his left side while striking out to lead off the game. Coleman swung hard at a third strike in the dirt and then stumbled out of the box. He went on to play in left for one inning, but was replaced by DARYL BOSTON in the second. The initial medical examination diagnosed the injury as a strained abdominal muscle, and determined Coleman's status to be day to day. DAVE MAGADAN has hit in 11 straight games. BASEBALL
Amoco Petroleum Products Marketing, a division of the Amoco Corporation, has  abruptly left Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., after almost a year and, without  a review, named as its primary agency the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago. The billings were estimated at $30 million. "It was a mutual parting of the ways" primarily related to "creative differences," Arline Datu, a spokeswoman for Amoco in Chicago, said Friday. Mark O. Benner, senior vice president for marketing services at Campbell-Ewald, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, agreed, saying, "The fundamental issue was that we were not able to reach a common agreement on creative strategy." Campbell-Ewald was awarded the account for the Amoco retail outlets and the  products they sell in late March 1995. Before that, Amoco had worked for 40 years with the Chicago office of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, which resigned when the account was placed in review. Burnett has been without a gasoline account since October 1994, when Burnett and the 76 Products Company unit of the Unocal Corporation agreed to part company after 56 years. THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA
Rock-and-roll has long been a fervent expression of a younger generation's rebellious freedom. But the deaths of three fans at a heavy-metal concert in Salt Lake City last weekend have forced promoters and arena managers to reconsider how much freedom to allow concert goers. Questions have risen about whether to restrict or ban the common arrangement where fans, instead of having an assigned seat, freely roam the concert hall in the style of open-air rock festivals. Many say such festival seating creates a sweaty, throbbing mass on the open floor before the stage, inviting injury or, as in Utah, death.  'Just Asking for Trouble' "Nobody should lose their life going to a rock concert," Barry E. Fey, a Denver concert promoter, said. "You're just asking for trouble with festival seating. You've seen the last of it now." But other promoters, rock bands and arena managers said last week that festival seating was part of rock-and-roll's tradition and was safe if well controlled. "That guy on the stage, they idolize him, worship him," said Jerry Mickelson, a partner at Jam, a concert promotion concern in Chicago. Fans "like the excitement of being close to the stage, of standing next to somebody else and feeling the vibration that goes through the entire crowd." The three teen-agers who died at the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City were trampled by a sudden surge of the crowd as the band AC/DC, known for its hard-driving sound, began to play. Security guards near the stage struggled to reach the fans who had fallen as the band, evidently unaware of the crush, played on.  Changes in Policy While some arenas will continue to allow festival seating, the Salt Palace has suspending it pending an investigation. The Nashville Municipal Auditorium, fearing a repeat of the Utah incident, modified its seating arrangement for a performance tonight by AC/DC. Fans will not be assigned a seat but will be required to sit in one. Security will also be tighter. "We called the band and expressed our concerns," said Robert E. Highsmith, the manager of the auditorium, which normally allows festival seating. "And the band has agreed that the chairs go down on this show." Such concerns about festival seating are not new. In December 1979, 11 people died when they were trampled as a crowd stormed an entrance to Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati, where The Who was performing. Seating for the concert was general admission. After the Cincinnati concert, many cities, including Cincinnati, outlawed festival seating, as did individual arenas and stadiums. Only 10 percent to 20 percent of concerts with more than 10,000 people still use festival seating, according to the North American Concert Promoters Association in New York. Arenas that still allow festival seating have adopted new safety procedures and installed crowd-control devices over the last decade. R. V. Baugus, a spokesman for the International Association of Auditorium Managers, said safety measures varied from show to show because some bands, like heavy metal and rap groups, tended attract a more volatile crowd than others. "What you do at a rock concert in Utah is different than what you do for, say, Pavarotti in New York," Mr. Baugus said.  Through a Cattle Chute Metal detectors are now used routinely. An average-size show will have 100 to 200 security guards. Fans at Kansas Coliseum in Wichita, which still allows festival seating, are herded into the arena through modified cattle chutes. "In festival seating, you have to address quite a few problems" that "start on the outside and work on in to the stage," the coliseum director, Sam E. Fulco, said. Inside, five-foot concrete storm pipes, are arrayed on end in front of the stage to break the momentum of crowd surges the way barrier islands break ocean waves. Selland Arena in Fresno, Calif., does the same thing with the concrete manhole structures, and the Tacoma Dome in Washington assembles three barriers that protrude from the stage like fingers. Some people say safety restrictions at concerts have dulled part of the thrill of rock-and-roll. The Grateful Dead, in fact, requests that its concerts have festival seating whenever possible. The band's publicist, Dennis McNally, said festival seating implied "freedom, and freedom's always a risky business." But, he said, "rock-and-roll has a tradition. It's always been dance music. And the Grateful Dead's a dance band."

FEW new products from Detroit in recent years have provoked as much curiosity on Wall Street as the Chrysler Corporation's midsized models, code-named L/H and set to be sold as the Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision and Chrysler Concorde. Accordingly, several financial analysts took the unusual step this week of attending the L/H debut in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., held principally for automotive journalists. The debut, held in three sessions to accommodate everyone, consisted of technical briefings by Chrysler executives and test drives of Intrepids, Visions and Concordes over several hundred miles through horse country and the 112-degree heat of Borrego Springs, Calif. Cars made by competitors were available, too. So analysts and reviewers could drive a $19,000 Intrepid for a while, and then switch to a $30,000 Acura Legend to see how they compared. Too often in the past, Chrysler cars compared poorly. Hobbled by rock-bottom credit ratings and unfinanced pension liabilities of some $4 billion, Chrysler now needs a "home run" car to restore financial stability and confidence. The Ford Motor Company -- and its common stock -- received just such a lift in the mid-80's when its Taurus and Sable midsized models became smash hits. Analysts were optimistic when they saw hand-built L/H prototypes last year. But they were eager to assess how L/H's built on production tooling compared with cars like the Taurus, Toyota Camry and the Legend, which are competitive on either size or price. They were also keen to hear professional judgments of automotive reviewers, because their recommendations often shape consumers' early buying patterns. "Certainly some cars the reviewers love don't sell well," said Jerry G. Paul, automotive analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, which owns about 20 million Chrysler shares. "But it's a lot easier for a car to sell well if they love it than if they don't." The reaction of Kathy Hamilton, senior editor of Automobile magazine, seemed to exemplify what most automotive writers were saying: "The consensus was that this is an exceptional automobile. It definitely was major league, in my opinion, and the first American car I've seen in a long time that you could call state of the art." Reviews of the L/H cars will begin appearing next week; the cars will trickle into dealerships during August and September and become more readily available later in the fall. Chrysler executives say the L/H proves they have been able to restructure their development process from a hierarchical system to a team system, in the manner of the best of their Japanese competitors. Most of the 22 automotive analysts tracked by Zaks Investment Research in Chicago are already recommending either a full-fledged buy or a buy-hold on Chrysler stock. The main reason for the buy signal is that the economy is in an early phase of recovery, which usually spells price appreciation for the cyclical automotive stocks. But if the L/H succeeds "it could give the stock an especially strong tailwind," Mr. Paul said. Analysts warn that Chrysler must still prove it can maintain the quality of the L/Hs's when the assembly line cranks up to speed. And the economy must grow robustly enough to provide buyers. Given those caveats, the L/H could once more turn Chrysler stock into a great turnaround story. Harvey Heinbach, Merrill Lynch's automotive analyst, said that driving the L/H and listening to reviewers extol its virtues reinforced his confidence in the No. 3 auto maker. If Chrysler sells 225,000 L/H's annually, pretax profit could top $1.1 billion, he estimated, representing a gross profit of $5,000 a car -- about what Chrysler earned during its best years from its highly profitable mini-van. The depressed price of Chrysler stock during the last two years reflects the auto maker's recent earnings performance: break-even in 1990 followed by a $795 million loss last year. But unlike Ford and the General Motors Corporation, Chrysler's balance sheet remains scarred by its near-bankruptcy in the early 1980's. The auto maker can no longer borrow money in public credit markets. In December, when Chrysler was forced to raise $350 million of new equity, its common stock was selling for roughly $10 a share. That compared with a peak of $48 a share just before the market crash of 1987. Yesterday, shares closed at $18.50, down 62.5 cents.
The United States Embassy began a voluntary evacuation of American citizens from throughout Saudi Arabia today after the Scud missile attack Friday night that killed one person and wounded more than 30. American diplomats and embassy officials here also received temporary pay increases that included a 25 percent premium for dangerous duty. The evacuation covering Americans throughout the kingdom is a significant expansion of a voluntary departure program covering only the Eastern Province that was begun by the State Department on Sunday. The expansion was also a departure from previous guidelines, under which United States officials sought to minimize the Iraqi military threat to Americans living in central Arabia and points south of the border provinces. The "low-key approach," as one Western diplomat called it, differed from that of other Western embassies, virtually all of which encouraged dependents and nonessential workers to leave. The American policy was aimed at reassuring the Saudi Government and avoiding panic among Saudi citizens.  Many Head for Jidda "It was pretty absurd," said a European diplomat. "The American Embassy was telling its people that there was no Scud danger to Riyadh as buildings were literally shaking around us." Saudis needed no guidance from their Government today. After Friday night's attack, a steady stream of vehicles were seen leaving the city for Jidda, beyond Scud range. Mecca and Medina, the two cities holy to Muslims, are also popular destinations, since Saudis say that President Saddam Hussein would never dare attack them. Embassy officials were known to have pressed Washington for weeks to change the State Department's limited travel advisory. Washington repeatedly rejected those requests until pressure from the 16,000-strong American community overcame Administration objections. Daily flights from Dhahran began on Jan. 20, three days after commercial air service was canceled. An American official said about 850 Americans and 40 Canadians had left through Dhahran on a total of 18 Military Airlift Command flights, and passengers were brought to military bases in Spain and Germany. Embassy officials said today's flight from the capital would accommodate 50 passengers and that a waiting list had been compiled containing 200 more names.
To the Editor: Selective Service officials, you report (news article, Feb. 4), say that "no special preparations have been made" to reinstitute the military draft. You present no evidence opposed to the official view. However, documentation that this is simply not true arrived in my mail last week. My hometown quarterly, Fair Haven Newsletter, contained the following notice: "The Mayor has received a letter from the United States Selective Service requesting a list of volunteers to serve on the draft board in the event the crisis in the Middle East requires the institution of a draft." If this does not constitute special preparations, I'm not sure what would. PATRICIA ARVIDSON  Fair Haven, N.J., Feb. 4, 1991
The Catskill resort hotels, once known for ribald comedians, rubicund borscht and marathon games of Simon Says, are fast becoming centers for meditation, yoga and brown rice. And the nightclub singers and tummlers who once occupied their stages are giving way to gurus, swamis and other modern-day prophets. The New Age has arrived with a vengeance in this mountain region a two-hour drive northwest of Manhattan, and with it have come controversies over what local residents call "outsiders and weirdos," and lawsuits, especially over the tax-exempt status of the new religious groups. And while the Old Age still has a strong foothold -- best symbolized by the handful of big resort hotels that have maintained their attraction through the years, like Kutsher's, the Concord and the Villa Roma -- the signs of the New Age are everywhere. The Names Change, Too Hotel signs that once read Brickman, Gilbert's and Windsor have been removed and replaced with signs for the sprawling Shree Muktananda Ashram. The ashram, a Hindu meditation center on the grounds of the three former kosher hotels in South Fallsburg, has room for 3,000 guests, followers of a spiritual leader affectionately known as Gurumayi, who begin their day at 5:30 A.M. with Sanskrit chants. And on a hilltop in nearby Woodbourne, the Haywire Dude Ranch's shingle now reads the Yoga Ranch. The shift in the Catskills is not only from borscht to brown rice. Drug-rehabilitation centers, homes for the mentally retarded and Orthodox yeshivas have also replaced some of the old hotels. The changes have happened so quickly that nostalgia here is not just for the old. Even 30- and 40-year-olds remember a very different Catskills. Alan Barrish, the son of a maitre d'hotel and a waitress who spent their careers in the Catskills, is 43 and the town historian of Thompson, one of the 16 towns of Sullivan County, the heart of the Catskills. When asked what led to the change, Mr. Barrish says simply, "Assimilation and air-conditioning." Since the late 1800's, Jewish immigrants and a smaller number of Italian and Irish city dwellers came to the Catskills to escape the summer heat and gather with people who would accept them -- namely, their own. But today the children of these immigrants have found few social barriers and can be found summering in the Hamptons and Barbados or the south of France. Realizing they were losing their hold on a constituency, the Catskills hotels fought back in the 1970's and 1980's by introducing new menus (beyond kosher, pasta and corned beef and cabbage) and special weekends for singles and lovers of mysteries or country and western music. At the same time, the New Age centers were getting a foothold in the area. But as the New Age centers grew, the old hotels continued their decline. While more than 300 resort hotels dotted the Catskills landscape in the 1950's, fewer than a dozen remain, said Mr. Barrish, who is also the director of the public library in Monticello, Sullivan's county seat. Isolationist Period A fellow town historian, 39-year-old John Conway of Highland, said that in the last century the hotels have come "full circle." He noted that they began by catering exclusively to one group and then enjoyed a period of broadening when Jews, Italians and the Irish mingled in their swimming pools and lounges. Today, he said, "it seems like we're back to segregation," with groups once again gathering by special interest. Examples abound. A few miles north of here in the town of Fremont, the Tennanah Lake House is now the Foundation for a Course in Miracles. Devotees at the turn-of-the century lakeside lodge study a scripture that they believe was dictated by Jesus to a middle-aged Jewish woman and serves as a correction to the Bible. And a few miles to the south, in Cuddebackville, the sign for Deerpark Farms Resort has been papered over with the words Elat Chayyim. A Jewish retreat center, Elat Chayyim has been celebrating this summer everything from Hasidic thought and the feminine aspects of "the God/ dess" to vegetarianism and gay, lesbian and bisexual Jews. Elat Chayyim, in its first year of operation, is a latecomer to the scene, but its sponsors believed it was needed in part because so many Jews were being drawn to the new Hindu and Christian centers. "We want to give them an option to explore what they found at the ashrams in a Jewish context," said the director of the center, Jeff Roth, a 40-year-old Reconstructionist rabbi. One group that has kept coming steadily through all the transitions are Hasidic and other Orthodox Jews; they congregate in bungalow colonies and hotels by sect or Brooklyn neighborhood, virtually carrying entire communities here for the summer. On a drive through the Catskills, Mr. Barrish points to the telltale sign of the Orthodox summer community: a makeshift plywood wall surrounds the pool to guard the modesty of the swimmers from passers-by. Schools and Communities Orthodox yeshivas have been buying up the old hotels by the dozen and creating year-round communities that accommodate adult male students and their wives and children, as well as Hasidic faculty and staff members and their families. Kiamesha Lake's Gibber Hotel is now being renovated to house the Viznitz Yeshiva for Boys, a Hasidic school. Beneath the bright gold and blue sign for the new school, passers-by can see the faded bottom line of an old Gibber sign that announces anachronistically: "Nite Club Open to the Public." Along with the yeshivas and the ashrams have come drug-rehabilitation centers and homes for the mentally retarded. The agencies that operate these centers have found the old hotels provide a perfect environment to get their clients out of dangerous or temptation-filled cities. Mr. Barrish points them out: Paul's Hotel in Swan Lake is now Daytop Village, the Roxy in Loch Sheldrake is now New Hope and the Delmar in Liberty is now Redirections. He also points to what he calls the "archeological ruins," like the dilapidated handball court of the abandoned Hotel Plaza in South Fallsburg. "This represents the transformation of a purely urban game to the country," he said. "No one here played handball until the city people came." Today, no one plays handball there at all; weeds and grass push up through the cracks in the concrete. The burned and abandoned hotels have, of course, gone off the tax rolls. And so have the hotels that have become religious institutions and nonprofit group homes. Under state law, churches, synagogues and other religious institutions are exempt from paying property taxes. Several of the Catskills towns have tried to deny religious exemption to the new groups. Some of the towns, like Fremont, argued that groups like the Foundation for a Course in Miracles were not legitimate religious institutions because they have no worship, clergy or rituals. Other towns, like South Fallsburg, did not argue that the groups were not legitimate but said that the exemption should be limited only to the community's temple, church or synagogue and not extend to residential and recreational areas. In virtually every case, the state courts have ruled for the religious groups, upholding their full tax-exempt status. Earthly Burdens Richard Kerbel, the town manager of Fallsburg, which includes South Fallsburg, said that the town would continue the litigation and appeals in the hope of "distributing the tax burden equally." He said that he was happy that the old hotels were given new life by the religious groups but troubled by the town's status as having one of the highest percentages of religious exemptions in the state. "It gives the yeshivas and the ashrams an unfair advantage," he said. Representatives of the Muktananda Ashram argue that they are good citizens who make a real contribution to the community, even if they do not pay property taxes. They recently issued a four-page review of their community involvement that noted that they employed local contractors, patronized local merchants and stimulated the housing market and that they recently held a fund-raising dinner that raised $85,000 for a local hospital. But at least one neighbor was not mollified. "It's a cult," said Eileen Revela, 40, who lives next door to the ashram. "I'd be happier with a burned-out shell." She said she was not impressed with the improvements that the ashram had made on its property, including the stunning new marble and glass temple or the four-story meditation mountain, which monks in traditional orange robes gravely ascend. The ashram, Ms. Revela added, has added to the cost of police and fire protection, road maintenance, sewage treatment and sanitation. Since the ashram first started buying up property in the town in 1979, she said, her property taxes have tripled. South Fallsburg's other ashram, whose full name is the Shivananda Sharam Yoga Ranch, has engendered less opposition. After opening in 1974, it did not continue buying up new land, as the Muktananda Ashram did, and it draws far fewer people, about a hundred a week rather than thousands. The head of the ashram, Swami Sankaranda, wore an orange sweatsuit as he offered Mr. Barrish and a visitor tea in the ashram's simple wooden temple. The Swami, who was born to a Jewish family 42 years ago in South Africa, said that the religious retreat centers that now dot the Catskills serve a spiritual purpose that transcends any individual faith. "This is the heart of the old Borscht Belt, a place long dedicated to materialism," he said. There is a certain justice, he said, in using those same nightclubs where people danced the rhumba for meditation and those same dining rooms where people ate flanken for vegetarian food. "Maybe," he said, "we've come back to cleanse these mountains from the material world."
LEAD: THE joke among Israeli farmers runs like this: A farmer goes to his rabbi and says, ''Rabbi, I have a terrible problem, my chickens are dying. What should I do?'' ''Feed them rice,'' says the rabbi. A few weeks later the farmer returns and says, ''Rabbi, my chickens are still dying. What should I do? THE joke among Israeli farmers runs like this: A farmer goes to his rabbi and says, ''Rabbi, I have a terrible problem, my chickens are dying. What should I do?'' ''Feed them rice,'' says the rabbi. A few weeks later the farmer returns and says, ''Rabbi, my chickens are still dying. What should I do?'' ''Feed them potatoes,'' says the rabbi. A few more weeks pass and the weary farmer returns again, and says with a sigh: ''Rabbi, my chickens are still dying. Do you have any more ideas?'' ''Ideas? I've got plenty of ideas,'' says the Rabbi, ''But do you have more chickens?'' As Israeli farmers see it, the Israeli Government and banks are the rabbis, freely dispensing advice and then watching - albeit with some pain - while more farmers collapse in debt. Israel is now suffering through a farm crisis so complicated and enormous it would make Iowans stand up and take notice. Only a large-scale Government bailout will solve it. The crisis is partly the result of Israel's attempt to buck the worldwide trend to larger farms and fewer farmers and partly the result of some colossal mismanagement by farmers, bankers and the government. It is also a classic example of how economic problems that are masked by a prolonged period of high inflation - when it doesn't matter if a business makes a profit, only how it manages money - become starkly apparent when an economy stabilizes. ''There is going to be a revolution in agriculture here,'' said Shimon Ravid, an official of the Histadruth labor union who is an expert on the crisis. ''Ten years from now there will be a totally different map to this country.'' At the center of the revolution are the semi-cooperative moshav farmers, who account for almost half of the country's annual agricultural production of $2.2 billion. The 27,000 families living on the 420 semicooperative moshav farms are intertwined in a $1.2 billion tangle of debts that would make the Gordian knot look like a bow tie. About half the debt was run up in the last two-and-a-half years. Three different groups supply Israel's agricultural production. Private farmers, both Arabs and Jews, account for about 10 percent. Another 40 percent comes from the 280 socialist kibbutz farms whose members share fields, homes and income. The kibbutz way of life was not for everyone, so in the early 20th century a group of more capitalist-minded kibbutzniks broke off and started the moshav system. In most moshavs, each family has its own house and a three- or four-acre plot, which it farms for its own profit or loss. But moshav members are united as a co-op for buying supplies, marketing products, providing community services - and raising capital from the banks. Under this system, every family guarantees the debts of all other moshav families and every moshav guarantees the debts of all other moshavs in its regional group. These mutual guarantees are the key to understanding the current crisis, which traces its roots to the mid-1970's, when the global trend toward large mechanized farms with relatively few farmers began to pose a serious dilemma for Israel. ISRAEL'S founders had always viewed agriculture as a way of life, not just a means of living. The notion of creating a ''new Jewish man'' by taking people out of the ghetto and putting them to work on the land was deeply embedded in the ethos of Zionism. At the same time, the Zionists needed self-sustaining agricultural communities to secure their hold on the land and to distribute immigrants around the country. So the Government did all it could, through subsidies and cheap financing, to increase output from small plots to make it feasible for as many Israelis as possible to stay in agriculture - in an age when technological advances were making small-time farming a dwindling occupation. The kibbutzim adjusted easily to the new age. They had large consolidated fields and could build businesses to absorb workers no longer needed on the farm. ''In America, people moved from the farm to the city, but here we could not afford that,'' said Mr. Ravid, ''So what the kibbutz did was move the city to the farm.'' The moshavs, however, failed to make the transition - because of internal problems and some financial mismanagment. The internal problems grew out of the fact that few moshavs had the capital or the cohesion to start and run their own businesses, which put even more pressure on them to produce income from their small plots of land. The pressure built in the 1970's and 1980's, when the children of many moshav founders came of age and wanted to work in town but live near their parents in the attractive rural setting. This gradually weakened the co-op: It meant that some moshavniks were farmers needing regular bank financing and some were non-farmers who worked outside - but everyone was still responsible for everyone else's debts. The financial mismanagement grew out of another development. Over the years, groups of moshavs had banded together to form regional co-ops, whose original purpose was to provide marketing facilities, cold storage and slaughter houses for 30 or 40 moshavs. But the banks gradually preferred to lend to regional co-ops, because of their size. The regionals would then re-lend to individual moshavniks, who were to pay off the loans out of their farm production. The problem was that many regional co-ops were loosely managed: They passed out money without collateral and for almost any purpose. Not all of this easy money went into tractors and seed - as can be seen by the big American-style suburban houses and pools at many moshavs. The regional co-ops, encouraged by the Government, also started borrowing to expand their economic enterprises and to pack their staffs. The banks lent to them freely - assuming, Mr. Ravid and others say, that if they got into trouble the Government would bail them out. ''The regional co-ops became a monster,'' said Ra'anan Naim, a leading member of the moshav movement from Ramot Naftali here in northern Israel. ''They lost touch with what they were created for and overtook their creators.'' Moreover, in the late 1970's, when inflation was rampant and loans were not indexed to inflation, many moshav farmers borrowed short term as much as they could and let inflation pay their debts. Even when short-term loans were indexed in the early 1980's, inflation moved so fast that real rates were often only 2 or 3 percent. ''Buy a herd and pay it off with a calf,'' was a popular slogan. Then came July 1, 1985. After a decade of high inflation, the Israeli Government introduced Draconian economic measures that froze wages and prices. Inflation succumbed, plummeting overnight to 2 percent a month from 20 percent. Suddenly, the moshav farmers who had borrowed freely at rates of 15 or 20 percent a month when prices of their chickens or apples were rising at least as rapidly were stuck paying off loans at those rates with their crop prices frozen. Welcome to the world of 500 percent real interest rates. Many moshavniks saw themselves as the main victims of the austerity plan. But Bank of Israel governor Michael Bruno argued: ''The economic stabilization program unearthed economic problems, but did not cause them. What the moshav crisis demonstrates is that once you stabilize, you reveal structural problems.'' The total moshav debt, a manageable $600 million on July 1, 1985, almost doubled in a year. Since many farmers could not make payments on time, interest piled up on interest; the $1.2 billion debt is now rising by about $650,000 every 24 hours. Many regional co-ops defaulted, and the banks called on their member moshavs to honor the mutual guarantees and pay up. Then, said Gedalya Gal, secretary general of the moshav movement, ''it didn't matter whether your moshav was healthy, which many were, or sick; everyone was tied to everyone else's debts.'' As that became clear, things started to get ugly. ''It was everyone to his own tent,'' said Mr. Na'im. ''People started asking: 'Why should I be responsible for the parasites? Why should I pay for others' mistakes?' '' Mr. Na'im's tightly run Moshav Ramot Naftali had not engaged in the festival of speculative borrowing and loose management. ''Today, we don't want anything from the Government but to be left alone,'' he said. ''All we ask is that they take our names off the loans of others. The regional co-op owes us $300,000. If we see 60 percent of that we will feel lucky.'' If they see 1 percent they will be lucky. Israel is not Iowa; the Government and the banks do not have the stomach for farm auctions. So in October 1986 the Government appointed Mr. Ravid to prepare a rescue plan with the banks and the moshavs. The Ravid Report, presented in February and still being debated, called for a combination of measures. The banks would have to write off about $100 million of the $1.2 billion in moshav debt and reschedule the rest - with the help of Government guarantees - at a reasonable rate. THE roughly 2,700 families - 10 percent of all moshavniks - considered to be hopelessly indebted would give up their land and water rights in return for having their debt wiped out. Their fields would be divided up among other moshav members, who would assume additional responsiblity for paying debts. As for the regional co-ops, they would go back to selling seeds and marketing and get out of the financing business. And mutual guarantees between moshav members, if they exist at all, would be highly restrictive. The challenge now, said Mr. Gal of the moshav movement, is to ''untie all the knots, and to save those moshavs like Ramot Naftali that are basically healthy once they are freed of the debts of others.'' Mr. Ravid argues that the moshav system itself still has underlying strengths. ''When you think that only 10 percent of the people could not pay their debts, which doubled in two years, I don't think that you can speak of the failure of a system,'' he said. Still, he predicts that when and if the current problems are resolved, there will probably be only 100 classic moshavs left 10 years from now, out of the current 420. The others will turn into villages, with a few people farming large consolidated tracts and all the others working in the city. That is already happening. When Sergio and Judy Orgorinsky moved into Moshav Kochav 14 years ago it was a classic moshav, complete with subsidized grocery store, communal swimming pool and mutual guarantees. But over the years the moshav sank deep into debt, largely because the Government urged it to build a plastics factory. No one knew how to manage the plant and it wound up manufacturing only debt. Today, Moshav Kochav is just a pleasant rural neighborhood. ''When we came here 14 years ago the moshav secretary would sit down with you and plan all your crops,'' said Mrs. Ogorinsky. ''Now everyone lives for himself. If you use the pool, you pay for it. The store is no longer subsidized, and if you need a loan you have to go to the bank yourself.'' Financially speaking, said Mrs. Ogorinsky, the present system is more rational since it encourages individual responsibility. ''The moshav is a beautiful way of life,'' she said. ''It was just mishandled. Maybe once the crisis is over it will be stronger, but I don't know who is going to foot the bill for the mistakes.'' It will probably be the Government and the banks. As concerned as they are about maintaining their way of life, the moshavniks are now in such deep and intertwined debt that many of them cannot even relate to it anymore. Now it's the banks' problem - a situation, said a leading Israeli agronomist, best summed up by another old joke. Yankele is tossing and turning in bed one night. His wife finally asks, ''Yankele, what is the problem?'' ''I owe Moishe money,'' he says. ''And I can't sleep worrying about it.'' So Yankele's wife gets out of bed, calls Moishe and tells him that Yankele cannot pay him the money he owes. ''There,'' she says, putting down the phone. ''Now you can go to sleep. Moishe is the one worrying.''
Tigers 5, Red Sox 1 DETROIT, June 24 (AP) -- Cecil Fielder homered twice today, leading the Detroit Tigers to a 5-1 victory over Boston, the seventh straight loss for the Red Sox. Fielder now has 60 runs batted in for the season, and despite a hitting slump (averagewise) in recent weeks, he has 27 r.b.i. for his 22 games in June. The two home runs he added today -- he had a grand slam Tuesday -- give him 16 for the season. Frank Tanana (6-5) pitched eight innings, allowing one run on seven hits, three of them by Tony Pena. Fielder led off the second inning with his 15th homer, into the upper deck in left field. His second home run, with Detroit leading by 3-1, came in the fifth with one man on. Twins 11, Angels 0 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Kevin Tapani pitched a two-hitter for Minnesota. Tapani (7-5) struck out a career-high 10 batters and walked none in his first complete game of the season. After allowing a two-out single by Rene Gonzales in the first inning, Tapani, 6-1 in his last nine starts, retired the next 18 batters until Junior Felix doubled with two out in the seventh inning. Chili Davis supplied Tapani with all the runs he needed, hitting a two-run homer in the bottom of the first. Athletics 7, Mariners 2 OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Rickey Henderson, once again the subject of controversy, doubled twice and scored twice and Dave Stewart (7-5) pitched Oakland to a victory that swept the series. The A's beat rookie Dave Fleming (10-3) who was bidding to become the league's first 11-game winner. Fleming allowed six runs on nine hits over five innings. Henderson, who said before the game that his Tuesday night demand to be traded was a joke, doubled in the first, moved to third on a sacrifice and came home on Mark McGwire's single. After a walk to Terry Steinbach, Harold Baines had a run-scoring single, his eighth r.b.i. in two days. Henderson doubled again in the fourth to score Lance Blankenship, who had singled. He stole third and Jose Canseco lined a single to right to bring Henderson home for a 4-0 lead. White Sox 4, Indians 3 CHICAGO (AP) -- Tim Raines singled home the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning as Chicago won its fifth straight and Cleveland lost its fifth in a row. Lance Johnson opened the ninth with an infield single against Ted Power (1-2), went to second on Craig Grebeck's sacrifice and took third on an infield out. Kevin Wickander relieved and Raines singled for his third hit of the game. Orioles 8, Brewers 4 MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Leo Gomez singled to break a ninth-inning tie, giving Baltimore the victory. Randy Milligan drew a leadoff walk in the ninth from Darren Holmes (2-2) and took third on Joe Orsulak's hit-and-run single. Gomez followed with a single past the drawn-in infield for a 5-4 lead. Mark McLemore and Jeff Tackett each hit r.b.i.-singlesand Mike Devereaux added a sacrifice fly. Blue Jays 3, Rangers 2 ARLINGTON, Tex. (AP) -- Roberto Alomar hit an r.b.i.-triple and scored on a wild pitch, capping a three-run rally in the fifth inning for Toronto. David Wells (3-2) allowed two runs on seven hits in six innings. He settled down after Texas scored twice in the first. Tom Henke pitched the ninth for his 13th save. It was his 413th appearance for Toronto, breaking the pitching record he shared with Dave Stieb. Expos 8, Phillies 1 MONTREAL (AP) -- Ken Hill pitched well and had two of Montreal's 11 hits -- including his first career home run -- as the Expos averted a three-game sweep. Moises Alou drove in three runs with two doubles, and Delino DeShields went 4 for 5 to lead the Expos, who had lost their previous three games. Hill's homer was the first by a Montreal pitcher since Kevin Gross against Fernando Valenzuela of the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 14, 1990. Hill (7-4) allowed six hits in six and one-third innings. Braves 5, Giants 0 ATLANTA (AP) -- John Smoltz pitched a two-hitter and struck out 10 as streaking Atlanta won its fifth straight victory. The Braves finished 11-1 on their homestand, the most successful in Atlanta history, bettering the 10-4 mark in 1991. The Braves won for the 21st time in 24 games. Atlanta starters are 16-1 with a 1.78 e.r.a. in the those 24 games. Smoltz (8-5) gave up a two-out single to Will Clark in the first inning and another two-out single to Clark in the ninth. Otis Nixon hit his first home run in nearly two years and drove in three runs. Cardinals 4, Pirates 1 PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Bob Tewksbury (8-2), pitching on three days' rest, threw six and one-third shutout innings and St. Louis avoided a three-game sweep by beating Pittsburgh. The Cardinals, who had lost eight of their previous nine games to Pittsburgh, scored all their runs in the fourth against Doug Drabek (5-6) on five ground-ball singles. Reds 9, Astros 6 CINCINNATI (AP) -- Hal Morris hit a three-run homer and Glenn Braggs had a two-run, pinch-hit double as Cincinnati beat Houston in a game that featured a bench-clearing brawl. The brawl broke out after Morris homered during a six-run Reds rally in the fifth inning. Pete Harnisch (3-7) threw the next pitch behind Reggie Sanders's head, setting off a free-for-all that held up play for eight minutes. Harnisch, Braggs, Reds reliever Rob Dibble and an Astros coach, Ed Ott, were ejected for their part in the fight.  BASEBALL
A jury today recommended the death penalty for the man who kidnapped 12-year-old Polly Klaas from a slumber party at her Northern California home in 1993 and murdered her near an abandoned lumber mill. The 42-year-old killer, Richard Allen Davis, appeared to smirk as the unanimous verdict was read. The decision by the six women and six men on the jury is not formally binding on the judge in the case, Thomas Hastings, but it is virtually unheard-of for a judge in California to overrule a jury that calls for a defendant's execution. Polly's grandfather, Joe Klaas, said the verdict marked the end for his family of ''a 34-month, agonizing journey toward hell.'' Mr. Davis, he added, ''can go the rest of the way alone.'' The crime had shocked people around the country. For weeks, it turned Polly's hometown of Petaluma -- the pastoral backdrop for television commercials in which Ronald Reagan once declared ''morning in America'' -- into the staging area for a huge search that drew support from movie stars and politicians. The capture of Mr. Davis only added to parents' fears that the judicial system did not adequately protect their children. He had spent most of his adult life in prison for a series of increasingly violent crimes and was on parole at the time of the killing after serving half of a 16-year sentence for another kidnapping. The case also gave strong impetus to California's ''three strikes'' law, one of the toughest of a growing number of state sentencing laws that require extended mandatory prison terms for repeat felony offenders. ''Because of this case, a lot has changed in several laws,'' the lead prosecutor, Greg Jacobs, said after the verdict. But Mr. Jacobs suggested that the principal lesson went beyond the judicial system: ''the idea that we have to watch our children and watch them very carefully and never let our guard down.'' The Klaas family never thought it had let its guard down. When Mr. Davis sneaked into the family's home shortly before 11 P.M. on the night of Oct. 1, 1993, brandished a knife and snatched Polly as she played a board game with two other young girls, her mother, Eve Nichol, and her half-sister were sleeping just down the hall. Less than two hours after the kidnapping, sheriff's deputies answering a trespassing complaint near Santa Rosa, about 25 miles north of Petaluma, came upon Mr. Davis with his white Ford Pinto stuck in a drainage ditch. But after questioning him and searching his car, they let him go, unaware that the police were searching for a man fitting his description. Polly's parents, who are divorced, began a two-month search that riveted the attention of people far beyond their quiet corner of Northern California. After Mr. Davis was finally captured on a drunken-driving charge and a parole violation and his hand was matched to a palm print left by the kidnapper, he confessed and told detectives where he had left Polly's body. At his trial, Mr. Davis's lawyer, Lorena Chandler, did not contest that her client had committed the crimes.  Instead, the defense argued that the killing was the result of a burglary gone awry and tried to rebut the prosecution's assertion that Mr. Davis had tried to sexually assault Polly. The charge of attempting a ''lewd act'' on a child was one of four special circumstances the jury weighed in deciding between a death sentence and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The jurors deliberated for four days before finding Mr. Davis guilty on of all 10 of the felony counts with which he was charged. Dispelling any thoughts that he might have felt remorse, Mr. Davis responded to that verdict on June 18 by turning to a television camera and raising the middle fingers of his hands. In their second deliberations, jurors took 23 hours to decide Mr. Davis deserved to die, disregarding his lawyer's assertion that he should be spared because he had been abused as a child himself. The jury foreman, Brian Bianco, said this afternoon that at one point in the deliberations, seven jurors were either undecided or arguing for life imprisonment. ''We sentenced a man to death,'' Mr. Bianco said. ''I cannot feel good about that. On the other hand it was the right thing to do.'' Lawyers for Mr. Davis said he would appeal the death sentence, a process that could take years. Should he lose on those motions, California's practice holds that Mr. Davis be executed by lethal injection. Polly's father, Marc Klaas, said he would attend Mr. Davis's execution. ''It will be nice to see him go down,'' Mr. Klaas said, ''but nobody likes to see a death, except people like Davis.''
The night seemed to hold such promise for the Yankees. There was a revised lineup for the fans to argue over, with Wade Boggs replacing Bernie Williams as the leadoff hitter. There was a baseball team in the Bronx that could legitimately dream about challenging for a division title. There was another rowdy crowd at Yankee Stadium. There was even a 3-2 lead over the A's in the seventh inning. But then the bullpen door opened and Steve Howe trotted into the game to replace Melido Perez. The hope was about to turn to horror. The score had since been tied, 3-3, the A's had two runners on base and the dangerous Ruben Sierra was ready. Very ready. Moments after Howe's arrival, Sierra drilled his second pitch over the left-field fence for a devastating three-run homer and some of those raucous fans were silently rushing home to catch the nightly news. The baseball news had suddenly turned dreary. Those of the 31,469 spectators who remained to witness the rest of Oakland's 8-3 victory were malicious toward Howe. After Sierra's blast, Howe made a throwing error and yielded two singles and was booed unmercifully for being the villain who destroyed New York's magical home streak of seven straight victories. Manager Buck Showalter relieved Howe, and the pitcher's ears, by bringing in Bobby Munoz. He then made Howe wait so he could usher him to the dugout as more booing filled the Stadium. A Managerial Escort "He probably wanted to shield me in case somebody fired something at me," said Howe, who waved his hat and stuck his tongue out at rowdy fans when he was serenaded at the Stadium June 29 against Detroit. "He was being kind. It didn't help." Who could blame them for being so volatile? They had grown accustomed to seeing victories in the Bronx, where the Yankees had won 14 of their last 16 games before last night's fiasco. Maybe the Yankees spoiled them. Maybe they thought the triumph was already in the victory column when Perez took a 3-2 lead into the seventh against the sixth-place A's. Obviously, it was not. Twelve A's batted during the six-run seventh inning to transform the tight game into a rout and doom the Yankees to their ninth loss in their last 11 games. The Yankees have led in eight of those nine losses. Guess what? In the wacky American League East, they are still a mere two games behind Toronto. But guess what else? Not only did the reeling Yankees begin their 11-game homestand with their fourth straight loss to the A's and skid to fourth place for the first time since May 7, they were also stung by injuries to Pat Kelly and Danny Tartabull in the third inning that may prove serious. Kelly bruised his left thigh in a collision with shortstop Mike Gallego while pursuing a chopper behind second base and Tartabull strained his right shoulder making a throw from right field to third base. Concerns Aplenty "I'm concerned about both of them," Showalter said. "Both of their injuries forced them to come out of the game." Showalter should also be concerned with Perez and his floundering bullpen. Perez, who failed to protect 2-1 and 3-2 leads, has been cast as a pitcher who is plagued by misfortune. But, now that he has lost three starts in a row and four of his last five decisions, the question must be asked whether missed chances and bad pitches are the real reasons for his problems. "I don't think nothing is going right for me right now," lamented Perez. The right-hander began the decisive seventh by walking No. 9 batter Mike Bordick, a poor start, and by allowing Rickey Henderson's single. With the runners in motion, Brent Gates slapped a single past Boggs that he might have fielded if he was not moving left to cover third base. Bad luck? It would not have been bad luck if Perez had not walked Bordick. Gates's run-scoring single tied the score, 3-3, and Howe was summoned to make the switch-hitting Sierra hit right-handed. It seemed like sound strategy because 8 of Sierra's 12 homers and 43 of his 55 runs batted in have been as a left-hander hitter, but the Yankee bullpen can make any late-inning strategy tenuous. Sierra spoiled Showalter's move in resounding fashion by crushing Howe's middle of the plate sinker into the dark night and producing the three biggest runs of the game. The pitch was supposed to be low and away, but Howe fired it right over the plate and Sierra made it vanish. "I just didn't have it," said Howe, who has combined with his bullpen buddies to allow 14 earned runs in the last 23 2/3 innings. "I'd love to blame it on something. I just didn't have anything." Howe was not alone. INSIDE PITCH After 128 straight games as the leadoff batter, BERNIE WILLIAMS was moved to sixth in the lineup Thursday with WADE BOGGS replacing him. Manager BUCK SHOWALTER made the move to reduce the pressure on Williams, who has only one stolen base in 67 games. "I really don't care where I hit in the lineup," Williams said. Boggs was comical about the switch and said: "I think it was a move we needed for more speed at the top of the lineup," and, "My goal is to get two stolen bases. Bernie only had one in the first half." In his 12th season, Boggs has 16 steals and none this year. . . . General Manager GENE MICHAEL has not slowed in his pursuit of a starter, but he conceded that his attempts to make a deal for one have been hamstrung by the tentative approach of other teams. "We're after a pitcher," he said. "Some teams aren't prepared to do it yet." Although Michael refused to say who the Yankees are interested in, Montreal's DENNIS MARTINEZ and San Diego's GREG HARRIS loom as candidates. BASEBALL
Something special was happening as the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden in London unveiled a new production by Klaus Michael Gruber of Wagner's ''Parsifal,'' conducted by Simon Rattle. Bernard Holland's review, Page 5.
The Hungarian Pastry Shop, as any of its hordes of regulars will eagerly tell you, is a Morningside Heights institution. Would-be philosophers, artists and intellectuals cram themselves into rickety wooden chairs, pile their books, laptops, croissants - and, of course, coffee - on rickety wooden tables, and sit discussing everything from politics to culture to sex for hours on end. The shop's cat-in-residence, a tricolored named Trixie, saunters down the narrow aisles as customers call to her by name and offer her bites of food from their plates. The place is deeply beloved by the neighborhood. But a competitor is hovering in the wings. Max Cafe, a hip up-and-comer 10 blocks north of Hungarian, on 122nd Street and Amsterdam Avenue, is seeking to develop its own legions of loyal coffee drinkers. The cafe, which opened two months ago, lacks the pastry shop's musty feel, and looks like a slice of Greenwich Village transplanted to South Harlem. Instead of small, hard chairs, there are plush velveteen sofas and love seats, perfect for lounging. Rich tapestries hang on walls, chandeliers dangle from ceilings and at night candles are lighted on every table. Slowly but inexorably, some customers who used to hang out at the pastry shop are heading north to test drive the newcomer. Max's younger feel is attracting younger customers who prefer the new establishment's open spaces and light, airy feel over the dark pastry shop. ''I was waiting for two months before it opened,'' said Aude Lagorce, a 23-year-old freelance writer who lives in Morningside Heights. ''I don't like the whole attitude at Hungarian. It's like this fake intellectual place for old people who don't want to go to Starbucks.'' Erin Graff Zivin, a graduate student at New York University who lives around the corner from the pastry shop, tried Max for the first time on a recent Sunday, typing away on her laptop, her drink perched on a nearby table. ''I love their coffee and their pastry, but it's too dark to work at Hungarian,'' said Ms. Zivin, who plans to return. ''I've tried quite a few times, but I've never been successful.'' Max Cafe is owned by Luigi Iasilli, who also owns the restaurant Max SoHa down the block along with two other Max restaurants downtown. Mr. Iasilli had the idea for moving into the area three years ago, he said, when he got lost in Harlem on his scooter; he found the space for Max SoHa just days later. Pamagiotis Binioris, who has owned the pastry shop since 1976, insists he is not worried. His shop is still crowded with regulars who swear they will never go anywhere else (''I'd feel guilty,'' said one woman who spends four hours a day there). But customer loyalty hasn't stopped Mr. Binioris from checking out the competition. ''I had dinner there the other night,'' he said with a smile. ''I think it's a very comfortable place.'' CHRISTOPHER JOHN FARAH NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS/SOUTH HARLEM
Bowing to Greek pressure, the European Community has once again postponed recognizing the independence of the Yugoslav republic of Macedonia but has left open the possibility of doing so in the coming months. Greece has strongly opposed recognition of the southern Yugoslav republic on its borders as long as it uses a name that Athens sees as historically Greek. Athens also fears that nationalist groups next door will rekindle the violent fights of earlier this century over reuniting the fractured parts of Macedonia. Since the 12-nation European Community, which includes Greece, recognized the independence of the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Slovenia, it has been under pressure to do likewise with Macedonia. But at three sessions of the community foreign ministers, Greece has managed to block action on the issue. Officials in several capitals said today that they were still hoping to reach a common position, and France and Germany appeared particularly anxious to avoid a public rift of the kind that arose earlier this year over recognizing Croatia and Slovenia. But if no consensus is possible, officials said, several countries are likely to ignore Greece and recognize the tiny republic individually. So far, only Bulgaria and Turkey have recognized Macedonia. "It's a delicate situation for the community," a German official said. "We recognize the sensitivities of Greece, but sooner or later we need a decision." West European officials are also debating whether Macedonia should get a share of the United Nations peacekeeping forces that are about to be sent to Yugoslavia. Yugoslav federal troops have largely withdrawn from Macedonia, and there has been no fighting in the southern territory, whose two million people are a mixture of ethnic Albanians, gypsies, Turks, Slavs and Walachians. Over the last several weeks, Macedonian officials have pleaded for recognition in European and North American capitals, arguing that it is vital to affirm their borders and to get access to foreign protection and economic aid. They have refused renewed requests by Serbia and Montenegro to join them in a new and smaller Yugoslavia. In Greece, the issue has become the subject of nationalist fervor, with some politicians declaring that the "usurping" of the name Macedonia, the symbol for ancient northern Greece, is cause for war. The Macedonian government in Yugoslavia has said that it has no territorial claims against Greece, but that it will not change its name.
LEAD: It was one of those meetings that are very much part of New York - a half-dozen people collected to talk to a hundred others in the middle of the day about something very important, but to which there were no real answers. This time it was ethics and although nobody really expected clear solutions, still a group of busy people had decided to spend a couple of hours talking about American ethical standards and what to do about them instead of going for a walk in the winter sun. It was one of those meetings that are very much part of New York - a half-dozen people collected to talk to a hundred others in the middle of the day about something very important, but to which there were no real answers. This time it was ethics and although nobody really expected clear solutions, still a group of busy people had decided to spend a couple of hours talking about American ethical standards and what to do about them instead of going for a walk in the winter sun. This time the discussion - they always are called ''panels'' - had a special point because it took place at the midtown offices of the American Jewish Committee, after awards were handed out for books on Jewish themes. Most Jews are aware that they neither invented nor are the sole guardians of ethical standards but still they experience a sense of depression when something goes ethically awry among a group of Jews or in Israel. Sometimes it is fear-rooted (will this encourage anti-Semitism?) but often the sadness comes from some lessening of collective self-image. Jews are not necessarily more ethical than any other group but they feel they are supposed to be. So when some among them are so obviously not, that tends to make for moroseness, a little slipping of mooring. The panel was not called to discuss simply Jewish ethics. Irangate was in mind, and so was acceptance of the homeless as part of the scenery. But this group also did worry about so many Jews being involved in the Wall Street scandals and the state of Israel enmeshing an American Jew in espionage against the United States, which they took as damaging to themselves, Israel and their country. That bouncy Socialist Michael Harrington spoke and of course he gave what-for to the capitalist system. He said that one of the ethical problems of this country was that the system was good at enriching ''paper entrepreneurs'' but not as good now at increasing the real wealth of the country through production. He said that in lecturing to college students he found there was idealism but that they did not know where to put it. He was proud that his own son Alexander had shown idealism by chalking up his very first arrest for demonstrating. Somebody suggested aloud matchmaking between Alexander and Amy Carter. At a table there was a mutter that then they should both go off to Russia and try a little demonstrating against Mr. Gorbachev, for a change. Mr. Harrington was enthusiastic about Hegel's point that there is no value in individual ethic but that it should come from the community. He did not say what kind of ethic that would produce in a Fascist or Communist society but clues may be contained within Hegel's ''The Phenomenology of the Spirit,'' which he recommended to all assembled. Mr. Harrington is a very peppy talker, even about Marx and Hegel. The Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, a Lutheran minister and writer, said that what the country needed most was rational deliberation, as among a free people, on how we ought to order our lives. He said that abortion was the most critical ethical issue but when it was raised people said who will decide what's right, as if that were the end of the matter instead of the beginning. There were a couple of other speakers but everybody was waiting for Elie Wiesel to sum up the discussion. Mr. Wiesel, in addition to winning the Nobel Peace Prize and writing books that may win him another Nobel, also teaches. Like all good teachers, he poses a question that bothers him and winds up bothering the audience. In this case, how does a human being best put to use, for other humans, the ideas, the experiences, the memories of a lifetime. Everybody knew that despite his eminence he was not pretending not to know, but really did not; nobody did. Mr. Wiesel said that whatever ethic was, it was not between God and man, but between man and man: ''God can take care of Himself.'' It did not sound at all impious, quite the reverse. Later, in the corridor, a noted Rabbi, Wolfe Kelman, told the tale of the Hasidic mystic who went into a place where harried, weary Jewish women were rushing about making matzohs for Passover, realized they were overworked and underpaid and refused to give the owner certification that the matzohs were kosher. ''There is blood on your matzohs,'' said the Hasid. Rabbi Kelman's point was that you can observe the letter of the religious law and still be a scoundrel. Afterward, people said that although there were no solutions they had received a lot to turn over in their minds, which of course is the point of these meetings in the middle of the day and makes them even better than a brisk wintertime walk. ON MY MIND
GORDON P. GETTY has offered $1.7 million to help rebuild the Globe Theater in London, providing the British do their part, the Shakespeare Globe Trust announced Tuesday. Their share, stipulated by Mr. Getty, would be $13.5 million allocated by the Government to complete the project, the trust said. The first phase of the Globe reconstruction, including the foundations and walls, was finished last year along the Thames River across from the London financial district. The open-air theater was built in 1599 at Bankside on the south side of the Thames. It burned down in 1613, was rebuilt the following year and was demolished in 1644. Mr. Getty, a composer, and his wife, ANN GETTY, are better known in philanthropic circles as generous contributors to opera companies. But the couple's English connection runs deep. Mr. Getty's late father, the billionaire J. Paul Getty, lived for 25 years at Sutton Place outside London before his death in 1976. Mrs. Getty operates Grove Weidenfeld, a New York publishing concern she created with the help of GEORGE WEIDENFELD, who heads the British publishing firm of Weidenfeld & Nicholson.
HALF the babies born in New York City go home from the hospital to families  with incomes below the poverty level. Something like 10 million children in this country lack health insurance. And, on average, American children spend 1,500 hours a year watching television, compared with just 900 in the classroom. But never mind all that. As a result of a public outcry, Calvin Klein Inc. has canceled its new advertising campaign -- including a controversial billboard in Manhattan's Times Square -- for a line of children's underwear. The ads showed children actually wearing the underwear, a fact that astonished and appalled conservative groups, psychologists and others. The odd thing about this latest business capitulation to fin de siecle Puritanism is that hardly any of those guardians of public morals have raised a voice against the everyday commercial abuse of children. TV series and advertising subject young viewers to a never-ending procession of violence and hucksterism, but it is only ads like Calvin Klein's -- decried as giving comfort to pedophiles -- that are removed from view. Consider the data. According to the Center for Media Education, a nonprofit group in Washington, an average child ''will witness more than 100,000 acts of violence on TV, including 8,000 murders'' by the time he  completes elementary school. The numbers double by the end of high school. Some reasonable people believe that seeing all this violence makes children become more violent, desensitizes them to real violence and gives them the impression that  the world is a sicker and more dangerous place than it really is. As for commercials, the Center for Media Education says the average viewer sees a million of them, including 100,000 for alcohol, by the age of 21. ''Children see at least an hour of commercials for every five hours of programs they watch on commercial TV,'' it noted, adding that most children under 6 don't even know they're being sold something when they watch commercials. Jerry Della Femina, the veteran ad executive, found it odd that critics focused on the  supposedly sexual undertones of the Klein ads. He found fault instead with the whole notion of selling high-priced undergarments for young children -- clothing that no one sees, after all, except in the ads. ''There is an obscenity here: selling designer underwear for little kids,'' he said. ''I wouldn't buy designer underwear for my kids.'' Indeed, Mr. Della Femina has observed just how ordinary, if artful, the Klein ads happened to be. ''Every one of your viewers,'' he said in a television interview, ''has a catalogue at home that has a children's  underwear ad in it that looks like this.'' Critics of the ads, along with those who advocate Internet censorship to protect children, seem to hark back to a time of sexual innocence that has somehow been lost. But it is far from clear just who introduced the sexual snake into the cultural garden. One of the Teletubbies seems gay to some people, a perception noted in the general press long before it was trumpeted by the National Liberty Journal of the Rev. Jerry Falwell. BUT was the past so innocent? Remember the Coppertone girl, with that cute little dog who pulls down her briefs to reveal that cute little tush? What happens when the forces of morality and good order discover that the sweet kid with the white bottom lives on at www.coppertone.com, right there on the product's Web page? Pedophiles, start your browsers! Yet there is no denying that some innocence has been lost. Can any grown-up today consider the relationship of Batman and Robin, or the tendency of Bugs Bunny to dress as a woman to bedevil Yosemite Sam,  as entirely without sexual implications? The characters haven't changed; the implications, celebrated or decried, are in the eye of the implicator. ''In a curious way,'' Jacob Weisberg wrote recently in Slate, the on-line magazine, ''gays, their friends and their enemies have all collaborated in destroying the sexual innocence of cartoon characters by making an issue out of it.'' American children, meanwhile, muddle along. Nearly a third are born out of wedlock. And in their final year of secondary school, students in the United States score near the bottom in international rankings of math literacy, just behind Lithuania (but ahead of Cyprus). Foreign children may beat the pants off ours in math, but don't worry. In Times Square, at least, you won't see American kids in their underwear.

When John G. Duffy, the chief executive of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, received a phone call last month inviting him to work on the biggest deal of his career, it was payback for a relationship forged in the Texas Panhandle a dozen years ago. The call came from Gregory L. Curl, head of strategic planning at Bank of America, which, to the surprise of Wall Street last week, ended up hiring Keefe, Bruyette, a boutique investment bank, as an adviser on its $35 billion acquisition of MBNA. For Keefe, Bruyette, which lost nearly a third of its employees -- including Mr. Duffy's 23-year-old son, Christopher -- in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the return to the deal-making spotlight is particularly gratifying. ''It's a nice Horatio Alger story,'' said John A. Kanas, chief executive of North Fork Bancorporation, a longtime client. ''These guys have not only survived; they've flourished.'' Keefe, Bruyette has done so through its research, perhaps its best-known activity, and through its ability to maintain relationships even as the banking industry has gone through wave upon wave of mergers and changes. For instance, Mr. Curl and Mr. Duffy first met in 1993, when Mr. Duffy was advising First Amarillo Bancorp, a Texas bank that was being acquired by Boatmen's Bancshares for $188 million. Mr. Curl was then a senior executive at Boatmen's, which was itself swallowed up by a predecessor to Bank of America three years later. ''Our relationships are not only with institutions, but with people,'' Mr. Duffy, 56, said. ''There is a long context here.'' Indeed, Keefe, Bruyette's 43-year history in the banking industry occasionally wins it a role in deals coveted by larger firms. It has long ties with companies that were once small and little known but are now among the largest in the industry. ''We don't give up as they get bigger,'' Mr. Duffy said. Those ties also figured in Keefe, Bruyette's selection last year as an adviser to GreenPoint Financial on its $6.3 billion takeover by North Fork. Mr. Duffy had known Thomas S. Johnson, chief executive of GreenPoint, since 1976, dating back to when Mr. Johnson was a senior executive at Chemical Bank. Mr. Duffy has known Mr. Kanas of North Fork since the early 1990's. ''They spend the time cultivating relationships,'' said Mr. Kanas, who credited Keefe, Bruyette with helping his bank recover from losses it suffered on real estate loans in the early 1990's. Mr. Duffy led an offering that raised $10 million for North Fork -- then a huge sum for the bank -- at a time when its stock had fallen and its reputation was tarnished. Keefe, Bruyette and the handful of other small firms specializing in the banking industry have also benefited from the consolidation between investment banks and commercial banks, Mr. Kanas said. When North Fork does a deal, he said, it is reluctant to use Citigroup or J.P. Morgan Chase, which he views as competitors. In its merger with GreenPoint, for example, North Fork was advised by Sandler O'Neill & Partners, another boutique bank. These conflicts were why Keefe, Bruyette was hired on the Bank of America deal, said people who took part. Across the table, representing MBNA, was another longtime Keefe ally: Edward D. Herlihy, a partner with the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, & Katz. Mr. Herlihy arranged for Keefe to take over a full floor at the law firm's Midtown Manhattan office in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11. Mr. Duffy acknowledged that his firm had some business thrown its way in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. But these days, he said, the firm's work stands on its own. ''Some people did us favors for maybe the first six months,'' he said. ''But after that, we've been competing tooth and nail with everyone else.'' When he meets with clients, the events of Sept. 11 ''come up in conversation, but more as an afterthought,'' he said. Keefe, Bruyette has quickly replaced the executives it lost on Sept. 11. The firm now employs 435, nearly twice what it had four years ago. Its research encompasses 329 financial companies in the United States, compared with 270 before the attacks. The firm also tracks 107 European companies through a research effort that it began last July out of London. The firm has more than $275 million in capital, Mr. Duffy said, up 75 percent since the attacks. ''They are good because they are everywhere,'' said Thomas Finucane, a co-manager of the John Hancock Financial Industries fund, noting that the firm still tracks small to midsize companies that ''have fallen by the wayside'' at the larger investment banks. A more distant memory is an insider trading scandal in 1999 involving Keefe, Bruyette's chief executive at the time, James J. McDermott Jr., just as Keefe was contemplating a public offering. Mr. McDermott, who spent five months in jail after being convicted of giving tips about potential bank mergers to an actress in X-rated movies, reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month in which he did not admit guilt but agreed to a lifetime ban from the securities industry. Keefe, Bruyette says it has no interest in reviving its plans to go public. Nor is it looking for an acquirer, Mr. Duffy said. The firm had been talking with BNP Paribas of France just before Sept. 11. Those negotiations were scuttled soon after, and Mr. Duffy has not been hunting for other partners. ''We can compete perfectly well, as this deal shows,'' Mr. Duffy said. ''And besides doing the work, we've proven we can keep our mouth shut.'' STREET SCENE

To the Editor: "Faced with complaints of veiled racism, the National Institutes of Health," you report (front page, Sept. 5), "withdrew financing of an academic conference on the search for a genetic basis for criminal behavior, forcing its indefinite postponement." However, you overlook the main thrust and context of the criticism of the "Genetic Factors in Crime" conference, which was scheduled for October at the University of Maryland. The conference was the tip of a much larger and more dangerous iceberg, the Federal "violence initiative," which remains largely untouched. The violence initiative was announced by Frederick Goodwin, psychiatrist director of the National Institute of Mental Health, addressing the National Mental Health Advisory Council last Feb. 11. Dr. Goodwin's remarks drew public criticism, as you reported March 8. Dr. Goodwin had compared the "high-impact inner city" to a jungle and its youth to rhesus monkeys who only want to kill one another, have sex and reproduce. A transcript of Dr. Goodwin's remarks, subsequently obtained by my organization, disclosed something yet more ominous -- his announcement and description of a giant new Federal program to identify potentially violent inner-city children based on biological and genetic "markers." Specifically rejecting psychosocial explanations for inner-city crime, the violence initiative focuses on allegedly biologically "vulnerable" children and youth for psychiatric diagnosis and preventive treatment. Dr. Goodwin estimates that 100,000 children, as young as 5, will be identified for psychiatric interventions. He called the violence initiative the No. 1 funding priority for the Federal mental health establishment in 1994. My organization has since obtained documentation that millions of dollars of Federal funds are being spent on violence initiative research and planning, including studies of both rhesus monkeys and inner-city children. Newly developed psychiatric drugs are being tested for violence prevention in monkey studies, and some psychiatrists are claiming they can be used in humans for the same purpose. It seems inevitable that the violence initiative will involve administering the same drugs to inner-city children. The widespread use of Ritalin to control aggressive children, frequently supported or initiated by public schools, has set a precedent for pharmacological intervention. As I describe in "Beyond Conflict" (New York, 1992), the violence initiative scapegoats black children and excuses society from facing racism, poverty, unemployment and other problems that cause crime and violence in the inner city. Working closely with members of the black community in New York City, Baltimore and Washington, my center developed a coalition against the violence initiative, focusing first on stopping the conference on genetic factors in crime. The success of the coalition in preventing that conference from taking place must not distract from the larger need to stop the violence initiative. PETER R.

To the Editor: ''Climate Expert Says NASA Tried to Silence Him'' (front page, Jan. 29) made a compelling case in support of another example of the Bush administration's effort to hide scientific findings that are contrary to its agenda. Public officials are supposed to do what is best for the public, but the president places more value on his agenda than on the public. The quote from George Deutsch, a NASA public affairs official, in which he says it is his job ''to make the president look good,'' clearly shows that the role of government appointees is not to work for the public good but for the good of the president. Yes, this view of public service for the public good is a tad naive, but the stakes are high. Misleading the public when it comes to science can have dire consequences. And when it comes to climate change, the president is putting the health of his administration ahead of the health of only the planet. John A. Cigliano  Allentown, Pa., Jan. 29, 2006 The writer is a conservation biologist.
For the next few days, if not years, Dick Haley, who helped the Steelers build a dynasty in the 1970's, will have a major impact on the direction of the Jets. Haley, well known and well respected around the National Football League, is the behind-the-scenes Jets player personnel director who has suddenly been given virtual general manager's status because of Dick Steinberg's illness. Steinberg, who is battling stomach cancer, is turning over many of his day-to-day duties to Haley. And if the owner, Leon Hess, is contemplating a major move in the wake of Steinberg's condition -- not to mention Steinberg's 32-48 record in five seasons -- he could very well give the post to the 57-year-old Haley. Haley has a player's eye for talent, having performed for seven years in the N.F.L. as a defensive back. Drafting for the Steelers, he tended to go for the great athlete, such as Rod Woodson, and placed emphasis on a gritty, wild-man approach to the game -- often at the expense of size. "Dick Haley was a tremendously competent person, a gentleman, and a real good judge of players," Art Rooney Jr., the Steelers' former personnel vice president, said yesterday. "The only harsh words we ever had was over his selection of a certain type of player," said Rooney. "A lot of that philosophy came from Chuck Noll. I said to Dick, 'If I want great athletes, I'll go to the Olympics -- and half of them will be women.' " Haley left the Steelers in 1992 to join the Jets. That move coincided with the end of the Chuck Noll era. Haley replaced Steinberg's previous right-hand man, Ron Wolf, who left to become general manager of the Packers. In the three drafts Haley has been involved in -- Steinberg has run the operation from top to bottom and has the final say -- all three No. 1 draft picks have turned into starters. Johnny Mitchell, the tight end, was the first, followed by middle linebacker Marvin Jones, and this year, cornerback Aaron Glenn. All have the potential to be impact players. In addition, 14 players from those drafts are on the roster, including another starter, tackle Siupeli Malamala. Also, Cal Dixon will probably be the center next year. Thus, at least five players from Haley's three drafts will be starting. Haley, who was not available this week for interviews, spent 20 years with the Steelers, most of them running the draft. Perhaps his most successful draft came in 1974 when the Steelers selected Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John Stallworth and Mike Webster. They were part of a core that captured four Super Bowls in six seasons. "A lot of people don't recognize the tremendous success we had with low-round draft choices," said Joe Gordon, the Steelers' communications director. "We had Mike Wagner and L. C. Greenwood and we had free agents Donnie Shell, Randy Grossman and Jim Clack." In Haley's later years with the Steelers, he also had a voice in pro personnel. Also, the Steelers' philosophy changed toward the end of his tenure, when they started drafting for size. "We used to talk draft philosophy and how to build a team," said Rooney. "I had this mathematical formula: players lasted five years, and if you could get 2.5 players a draft over those five years you'd be able to have a football team of 11 people." Haley agreed that the draft is the critical way to develop a team, a philosophy that remains with many football people despite free agency. On the Jets, the two-year record under free agency is 14-18. "I remember Dick as a freshman at Pitt," said Giants General Manager George Young. "He was a tailback and he played defense." Haley was a teammate of Mike Ditka and Foge Fazio, then went on to be drafted in 1959 by the Redskins, performed for two seasons, and joined Minnesota in the 1961 expansion draft. He moved to the Steelers, where he played from 1961 to 1964. He spent five years with the Blesto scouting combine before starting his 20-year stint with the Steelers. "They drafted the kind of people that Chuck Noll wanted," said Young. "I think Dick's an excellent person, a hard worker. Just like Dick Steinberg." Steinberg suggested that Haley, and the Jets' assistant general manager, James Harris, "could bring in some fresh ideas." Harris is the former quarterback who played for the Bills, Rams and Chargers. Harris, 47, who joined the Jets last year, was involved in the recruiting of experienced free agents such as Ronnie Lott. But Haley's presence on the club makes it easier for Hess to avoid a major shake-up. After all, a new general manager is very likely to want his own coaching staff.  FOOTBALL
Our clinic computers went on the blink last week, and work ground to a halt. The receptionists couldn't confirm scheduled appointments or make new ones. The nurses had no way to record vital signs or transmit phone messages. The billers couldn't bill. We doctors couldn't read our old notes or write new ones. We couldn't figure out if Mr. Jones needed blood tests today (as we suspected) or if he could put them off until November (as he maintained). We couldn't click the mouse once to prescribe a dozen medications; now every slip had to be laboriously written out by hand. And who remembers how to spell pyrazinamide anyway, let alone what size pills it comes in? When the computer prompts our every keystroke, we are lean, mean prescribing machines. Without it, we are just people with pens and pads fumbling through reference books. An hour into the chaos, a nurse muttered that as far as she was concerned, we might just as well all go home. Her verdict would have surprised the secretary of health and human services, Tommy Thompson, who has argued for years that health care is not nearly dependent enough on computers, and who has recently started a major federal initiative to correct this situation. Mr. Thompson likes to point out in speeches that grocery stores are more technologically advanced than most hospitals and clinics. And indeed, the average supermarket processes artichokes with more finesse than most hospitals do people. There are the scrawled, notoriously illegible doctors' orders. There are the handwritten signs that may or may not be noticed, taped to charts (''Caution! Patient with similar name!'') and above beds (''No blood drawing in left arm''). There is the pesky symmetry of the human body that leads proactive patients to ink arrows on their bodies before surgery. It's easy to fantasize that computerized orders, bar-coded patients and wireless communications can straighten everything out. Some hospitals are on their way to streamlined electronic perfection, and do report improvements. But others linger at the back of the pack, with computers that have yet to smooth the jolting, sometimes terrifying, potholes of working in a hospital, or of being admitted to one. The various computer systems in a hospital may not speak to one another. Patients may report they have had tests of which there appears to be no record at all, until a last-ditch phone call to an administrator of a separate computer system locates the results. Elisa Green and Elias Green may still get all mixed up, as may the three James Johnsons; their computerized charts often carry the same flag as their paper ones did: a pop-up box announcing ''Caution! Patient with similar name!'' that is pretty easy for someone in a hurry to ignore. Computers were no help in averting one of the worst near-disasters I'd seen in years: a tired resident pointed and clicked one patient's powerful dose of blood thinning medication onto another patient's orders. Some hospital systems might have been intelligent enough to have balked, but hers waved her through. It's anyone's guess if the pharmacy or the patient's nurse would have caught the error; fortunately, her supervisor happened to check her work that day. Both doctors, white-faced, learned instantaneously that computerization alone does not eliminate medical errors. Perhaps more computers or wiser computers are the solution, especially if they are programmed with whatever combination of fear, suspicion and conscience it is that makes supervising doctors compulsively check trainees' orders. Sometimes, though, it is tempting to wish for fewer, dumber computers instead. After all, if the intern had been writing orders on a bedside clipboard, the mistake would never have happened. Computer screens all look alike; patients' faces do not. In an essay published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in 2002, Dr. Steven Angelo wrote about the day his hospital computer crashed. For a few hours, the intensive care unit staff was unable to track a patient's blood pressure or heart rate by looking at a monitor. The chairs in the unit's nursing station, he wrote, slowly emptied out: the doctors and nurses had gone to sit with their patients. In our clinic, the computer monitors are placed in a way that the doctor can watch the screen or the patient, but not both. Frankly, it's not much of a contest. The monitors are mesmerizing, with their colors and windows, boxes and beeps, menus of pills ripe for the prescribing. Walk down the row of offices, and you see the patients looking at their doctors, and the doctors looking at their screens. Last week, when the system crashed, we looked at our patients instead.

To the Editor: Regarding "Prive's Ploy" (Dec. 12): Is this America, or what? I used to think that my money was just as good as anyone else's. Not so! Even my credit cards are useless. How unfortunate that I and many, many others are not part of the "scene" that this restaurant's owners are seeking. I used to be "chic, high-energy, smart, sexy" -- but that was before my hair turned white and I retired from teaching school. Did it ever occur to Prive's owners that the lucky ones are those who did not receive "the card"? The restaurants I visit are welcoming, the hosts happy to see me (and my money). To those who dine with people who are "fun" and "more fun than others," know that the rest of us are having lots of fun -- laughing at you. FLORENCE L. SANDS  Jackson Heights, Queens

Once again, talk of a Japanese selloff of United States Treasury bonds has been heard, briefly raising the possibility of new market tremors, but this time few investors seemed rattled. Indeed, it turns out that the Bank of Japan has been quietly selling some Treasury holdings for days, causing barely a stir. The latest speculation about a sale of bonds came on Sunday, when Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy research council, said the Government was considering selling some Treasuries to help troubled Japanese banks raise dollars they needed. Japanese news reports described Mr. Yamasaki's suggestion as more serious than the offhand comment made six months ago by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on the possibility of such sales, which rattled markets worldwide and sent United States stock prices down. But today the markets seemed to largely shrug off the possibility of a big Treasury bond sale. In the United States, stocks were mixed and bond prices only dipped. [Japanese stocks rallied sharply early Tuesday on reports that Mr. Hashimoto favors spending $77 billion to help financial companies write off bad loans. The Nikkei 225-stock index rose 518.16 points, or 3.22 percent, to 16,650.25.] Bankers and foreign-exchange brokers here said even before Mr. Yamasaki's proposal was reported that the nation's central bank had been selling some Treasury holdings to raise dollars in the repurchase market, meaning it has agreed to buy them back later. These sales are essentially loans using Treasury instruments as collateral, and do not increase the supply available. The central bank has been using the proceeds for loans to banks confronted with high borrowing costs. Lenders have cast an increasingly wary eye upon the health of the entire financial system, afterfour large institutions collapsed last month. The possibility that Japan might unload United States Treasury holdings, an idea heard from time to time, could have a big impact on the  markets. Japan is the largest foreign holder of United States Government debt, and a substantial sale could cause a supply glut that sends prices down and interest rates up. But Japanese officials said no selloff of Treasury bonds was envisioned. They noted that any money raised would be done through the repurchase market -- the same process the central bank is using. Behind Mr. Yamasaki's remarks seemed to be the idea that the central bank could temporarily lend the proceeds of bond sales to banks facing difficulty borrowing, thereby alleviating the credit squeeze. ''It's a way for the Government to give cheap financing to Japanese banks in a situation where the market is not judging credit risks in the same way it would under normal conditions,'' said Robert Alan Feldman of Salomon Brothers Asia. Foreign-exchange brokers said the central bank had entrusted the proceeds of sales made in recent days to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Sumitomo Bank, which in turn have made loans to their shakier brethren. A currency broker who spoke on condition of anonymity said some banks pressed for cash last week were now issuing certificates of deposit to other Japanese financial institutions that needed funds. . In that way, the Bank of Japan has solved the short-term financing problems many commercial banks have confronted. Indeed, the only footprint the central bank has left is in the ''Japan premium,'' the extra tenths of a percentage point that Japanese banks pay to borrow overseas. These premiums have fallen roughly in half. The central bank does not disclose its total United States bond holdings. All Japanese investors held slightly more than 6 percent, or $330 billion, in Treasuries at the end of 1996, said Ronald Bevacqua of Merrill Lynch. As such, Japanese investors as a group can influence United States bond prices and yields -- potential leverage in any economic dispute between the two largest economies. But few expect Japan to use it. Historically, the Japanese have held Treasury bills in times of distress, most recently in 1995, when concerns about the Japanese financial system made credit expensive. Second, interest rates in Japan are measured in tenths of a percent, rather than full percentage points, making Treasuries about the highest-yielding asset held by Japanese institutional investors. Third, this coming April 1, longstanding regulations curbing Japanese purchases of investments denominated in currencies other than yen will end, which could cause a flow of capital out of the country.. Already, the Japanese subsidiary of Citibank is reporting a large increase in its deposits. And Japanese banks, which are large holders of United States assets, cannot afford to cash out their Treasuries. As of March 31, most big banks  must meet the Bank of International Settlements' standard that they maintain capital equal to 8 percent of their assets. A reduction in their United States Treasury bills, which are considered virtually risk-free, would make that harder to achieve. The greatest curb on a Japanese sale of American bonds lies in the global consequences of such an action. ''From the Government's perspective, they're well aware of the implications of a large-scale liquidation of U.S. Treasuries, including higher interest rates worldwide and an increase in the Japan premium as well,'' said Kathy Matsui, Goldman Sachs Japan's chief market strategist here.
The Shea Stadium scoreboard went dark for a moment in the middle of the game. The reprieve for the Phillies, though, was brief. Power was restored, the electronic readout of Montreal's latest unfolding triumph was burning bright. The heat of the faraway lights became more intense by the inning. It was anyone's guess how hot it felt at the moment John Franco got the game's final out and the Mets were 5-4 victors over the Phillies. The defeat, the sixth in nine games for the Phillies, allowed the remarkably relentless Expos to close to four and a half games back in the National League East. "It should make things interesting," Franco said of his late-inning handiwork on the mound for the Mets. Smile, Smile, Smile Interesting was not perhaps the adjective popular in the Phillies' clubhouse. There, Danny Jackson, the starter and loser for Philadelphia, was swearing nonstop, railing against the injustice of "good pitches and cheap hits." Manager Jim Fregosi, who has lost his slugging outfielder Pete Incaviglia for an undetermined stretch, was forcing smiles and talking about injuries being a part of the game. A lot of players were staring at each other and determining how precisely to act. "I'm sick of making good pitches and seeing cheap hits laying all over the field," Jackson said. The Phillies were all but laid out on the field after an incompetent and crushing sixth inning. Jackson had retired the first two Mets and was ably protecting a 2-1 lead, one wrought by Ricky Jordan's two-run bolt off Frank Tanana in the third. But rookie shortstop Kevin Stocker misplayed a routine grounder, and then Jackson yielded a single to Dave Gallagher and walked Chico Walker. The implosion only needed a final spark, and it came with a crack off Jeff Kent's bat. Lenny Dykstra, perhaps fooled by the angle or acoustics of the hit, was late racing to Kent's soft fly to center. The baseball landed in front of Dykstra and then rolled past not only the center fielder but left fielder Milt Thompson, as well. Three runs scored. The Mets led, 4-2. They never trailed after that. What to do? "I can't do nothing about hits like that," Jackson said. "Neither can anyone else." After the hit, the Phillies couldn't do enough against the Mets to offset the damage. The Phillies scored a run in the seventh, but Bobby Thigpen gave it back in the bottom of the inning. And then Franco, after being fortunate that Darren Daulton probably hit too hard a double to right to put men on second and third with one out in the eight, got two outs while allowing only one run to score. An eventless ninth followed, and the Phillies exited with the scoreboard hot enough to shrink bravado. INSIDE PITCH FRANK TANANA got the victory with six innings of eight-strikeout work. . . . ANTHONY YOUNG, the right-hander with the 1-16 record in 1993 and the major league mark for unbroken futility on the mound, suffered his latest bit of bad luck when told he would have to undergo surgery on his left thumb and that his season was done. Young has a torn medial collateral ligament, an injury suffered while diving for a ball in Chicago earlier in the month. BASEBALL
LEAD: Local law-enforcement officials here have enlisted Federal agents and prosecutors to fight violent drug-dealing gangs that are moving into the Northwest. The approach, unusual in its reliance on Federal resources to fight drugs at the street level, is viewed as one of the most promising approaches in a war the authorities had long characterized as futile. Local law-enforcement officials here have enlisted Federal agents and prosecutors to fight violent drug-dealing gangs that are moving into the Northwest. The approach, unusual in its reliance on Federal resources to fight drugs at the street level, is viewed as one of the most promising approaches in a war the authorities had long characterized as futile. The program is intended to serve as a deterrent by charging suspected gang members with Federal crimes that carry far greater penalties than state statutes. It also puts pressure on gang members to become informers, helping agents to seize suspects at airports and bus stations as they arrive with weapons and drugs from their bases in Los Angeles. Federal and local law-enforcement officials say this combination has slowed the influx of drug dealers from Los Angeles into new territory. Inquiries From Other Cities The new approach, which was begun by the United States Attorney here after a request was made by the local police, is being closely watched by the police in more than two-dozen American cities where cocaine-dealing gangs from Los Angeles have gained a foothold. ''It's working so well for us,'' said Lieut. Jerry Adams of the Seattle police, ''that we've had requests from cities around the country asking us for help.'' Law-enforcement officials from Seattle and a dozen other cities gathered with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Kansas City today to develop a national strategy for fighting the Los Angeles gangs. Since last year, police officers in Denver, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City, St. Louis and Kansas City as well as on the West Coast have identified Los Angeles gang members dealing drugs on their streets. ''What we're seeing is the beginning and the potential for a nationwide network of drug dealers,'' Ira Reiner, the Los Angeles County District Attorney, said today at the Kansas City conference. ''This cannot be handled on a local level. It is a national problem and must be dealt with that way.'' Some civil rights advocates caution that Seattle's tactic of stopping suspected gang members at airports could lead to improper arrests of youths who simply look like gang members. But there have been no civil rights challenges to any of the arrests so far, and many politicians from crack-infested neighborhoods welcome the additional muscle of the Federal Government, saying it has put the first real scare into the drug gangs. 'It Gets Their Attention' ''These guys used to get off the plane wearing their colors and flaunting this stuff,'' said Bill Modesitt, who heads a Federal Drug Enforcement Agency unit at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport. ''But now when we stop them and they find out they're facing a mandatory five years for five grams of crack, they can't believe it. It gets their attention.'' One defendant, Derrick Hargress, whom Los Angeles authorities call a prominent leader of the Crips gang in that city, is facing a 40-year term after pleading guilty to a variety of charges in Seattle. As part of a possible reduction in sentence, he has written a letter to fellow Crips members in Los Angeles, warning them against coming to the Northwest. The Seattle approach is two-pronged. One part is the program at airport, train and bus stations, in which Federal agents rely on informers' tips and profiles of gang members to stop suspects as they enter the city. Those carrying drugs or who are wanted on warrants from other cities are arrested. The other part relies on turning over to the Federal authorities youths who have been arrested by the local police. Gene Anderson, the United States Attorney here, first used racketeering statutes against the gangs. But he said those laws generally were too cumbersome and complicated for the swift form of justice needed as a deterrent. Instead, he has been using Federal drug possession and weapons laws, and a relatively new statute that makes it a felony to sell narcotics within 1,000 feet of a school. Thus, for example, if a youth who is thought to be a gang member were arrested on a local drug charge near a school, Federal authorities would be notified so they could charge the suspect under the Federal statute. In three months, 25 out-of-state gang members have been indicted by Federal grand juries in Seattle on weapons, drug and other charges. While the number is comparatively small, the deterrent effect could be far-reaching, officials say. As a result of their indictments - in some cases for violating new laws that have been seldom enforced at the street level - the defendants are facing sentences of up to 50 years in jail. Local Officials Are Frustrated The authorities in Portland, Ore., say they plan to start some form of the Seattle program this month. They say their city does not have the jail space, the manpower or the range of local laws to combat gangs effectively. ''The frustration level is so great that people feel local government has completely failed them,'' said Charles Turner, the United States Attorney for Oregon. ''It's not the function of the Federal Government to prosecute street crime, but we can act as a general deterrent.'' He said a gang member arrested for selling drugs faces no more than 42 days in jail under Oregon law. And 50 percent of those who are arrested flee after posting bail, he said. Under Federal law, a gang member selling cocaine faces a mandatory five-year term and a minimum of another five years if found carrying a gun. Also, Federal laws make it much easier to detain gang members without bail or to ask for a high detention bond. #60,000 Crips and Bloods ''All of a sudden, a person who had no fear of the law may be looking at 10 years jail time,'' Mr. Anderson said. Faced with a choice of such a penalty or turning Government informer, many gang members here are deciding to give information to Government prosecutors. While hailing the three-month-old Seattle program, the United States Attorney in Los Angeles, Richard Bonner, warned that Federal resources are inadequate to begin a full Government attack in Los Angeles County, the home of most gangs in the West. The authorities estimate that two predominantly black youth gangs in the Los Angeles area, the Bloods and the Crips, have upwards of 60,000 members. On average, these machine gun-toting gangs commit about one murder a day. The authorities say some of the gang members who carried their trade to other cities have been quite obvious about wearing the color of their criminal unit, and could be easily spotted. Typical signs include a certain type of tennis shoe, a blue or red scarf or handkerchief, gold jewelry and hand signals. Since the crackdown at the Seattle airport, some gang members have tried to to foil the airport agents by arriving in sports coats and ties.
Adrian Branch is a guard who is 6 feet 7 inches tall. The Knicks need a big guard. He has played for Pat Riley, the Knicks' new coach, and is familiar with his system. He even owns a championship ring, courtesy of the 1987 Los Angeles Lakers. Advantage, Branch. When Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' vice president of player personnel, was putting together a roster stacked with players of athletic ability and speed for the rookie and free-agent camp currently in progess here at the SUNY campus, the call went out to the 27-year-old Branch. "It was all out of the blue," Branch said after today's practice. "I was hitting hard and heavy with some European teams, just trying to extend my career. All of a sudden, my representative, Jay Bell, said the Knicks were extending an invitation to the camp. So I said I'll come here and compete." Nothing New to Branch These camps are nothing new to the well-traveled Branch, the Chicago Bulls' 1985 second-round draft choice. Since being cut by the Bulls in training camp in his rookie season, he has played for the Nets, Portland Trail Blazers and Minnesota Timberwolves, as well as the Lakers, two Continental Basketball Association teams and last season for Monaco in the French League. "This is my seventh camp and the streak goes on," said Branch with a smile. "I'm one of the oldest here. When I got here, I felt like an overdue rain check. But I felt I had something to prove. My game is the open court. I enjoy playing. I hope I can bring some intensity to the Knicks." Riley, his first N.B.A. coach, likes what Branch has shown. "Adrian had his moments," said the Knicks' new coach, recalling Branch's days with the Lakers when he averaged 4.3 points in 32 games.  "There are always a couple of games a year that a player whether he's in the rotation or not has to pay the rent. In other words, he has to contribute something. That was Adrian." "He's more settled now. He used to play the game just wild, with reckless abandon. He's more in control now. I always liked Adrian. The reason we let him go was really a numbers problem more than anything else." BASKETBALL

Expected to be completed by the fall, a $10 million classroom building will be the centerpiece of the Pace University School of Law campus at 78 North Broadway in White Plains. The three-story 27,000-square-foot glass-and-stone building will house five horseshoe-shape classrooms, two of which will seat 100 students each, two with 60 seats and the last with 80, according to Dean Richard L. Ottinger. The 80-seat classroom on the first floor will let students connect laptop computers to the Pace network from their desks. The other rooms will also have computer hookups and audio-visual equipment. ''These classrooms are designed for teaching the Socratic method, which is essential for a law school,'' Mr. Ottinger said. ''Students can interact with each other and, of course, with the teacher.'' The new building will allow the Law School to free other space, including a floor of a building that will be the new home of a law clinic, John Jay Legal Services Inc., and the Career Development Office. They have been situated in the library. ''As a result, we'll be able to expand the library by 6,000 square feet to allow for additional study rooms, a computer laboratory and offices,'' said Mr. Ottinger, a former eight-term member of Congress. The new building will connect with two buildings, forming a quadrangle that will be the campus centerpiece, he said. The new building, designed by Lohan Associates of Chicago, ''will blend in with the existing buildings,'' Mr. Ottinger said, adding, ''The entire area will be landscaped and will replace a VIP parking area that's now taking up that space.'' In a survey of accredited law schools, the American Bar Association said Pace had outdated classrooms, according to Mr. Ottinger, ''and that we needed more space in our library.'' ''The new classroom building solves both problems at once,'' he said. The financing for the building is from a $55 million bond that the university secured last year from the State Dormitory Authority.
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the superlatives used by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to describe New York included an incorrect paraphrase. The Mayor said that around the world, New York City was often better known than America itself; he did not say the city was better known around the world than it is in America. In some editions, the picture caption with the article misidentified the building shown on the Mayor's Christmas cards. It is City Hall, not Gracie Mansion.
LEAD: President Nicolae Ceausescu of Rumania has criticized his ruling Communist Party and called for a program to modernize the food industry and improve consumer distribution, the state-run press reported today. President Nicolae Ceausescu of Rumania has criticized his ruling Communist Party and called for a program to modernize the food industry and improve consumer distribution, the state-run press reported today. In recent weeks, Mr. Ceausescu has shown an increasing interest in improving the supply of food in Rumania, in what some people speculate is an attempt to appease the its citizens and avert the demands for changes sweeping the rest of Eastern Europe. Mr. Ceausescu aimed the unusual criticism at the Communists in remarks on Friday at the first meeting of the Politburo since he was unanimously re-elected party leader last week at a party congress. At that congress, Mr. Ceausescu reaffirmed his opposition to more liberal policies. 'A Number of Problems Mr. Ceausescu, who rigidly controls Government and party affairs in Rumania, acknowledged at the meeting Friday that ''a number of problems emerged in the area of trade and proper supplies to the population,'' the press agency said. Under Mr. Ceausescu's centralized economy, Rumania, once the breadbasket of Eastern Europe, rations basic food staples like meat, white flour, cooking oil and bread. Fresh vegetables and fruit are scarce, even in spring and summer. Mr. Ceausescu said a ''special program was required to modernize the food and light industries, to better organize the shopping network and to meet the comsumer demands,'' the agency reported. It added that Mr. Ceausescu said the shortages would be alleviated within two years. Aiming his criticism at his party and its work, Mr. Ceausescu said the Politburo and the Central Committee must be improved. He said it was ''essential to strengthen the sense of responsibility, order and discipline for the firm application of the laws and the party decisions,'' the agency reported. Signs of Dissatisfaction Mr. Ceausescu called on the party leadership to improve communication with local party leaders and not take any decision that has not been discussed ''with the whole party.'' Although Mr. Ceausescu was unanimously re-elected party leader, there have been signs of dissatisfaction within the party. Rumania is a one-party state with no parliamentary opposition, and all important Government posts are held by Communists. The Politburo also criticized economic shortcomings, including factories operating at a loss and failures to meet export quotas. At the Politburo meeting, Mr. Ceausescu assumed responsibility for organizing an international conference of Communist parties ''as soon as possible.'' Mr. Ceausescu had proposed such a conference during the party congress, leading to speculation the hard-line leader could be seeking outside support in the face of the movements for change elsewhere in Eastern Europe, including Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.

Arrest orders for three top paramilitary commanders, leaders of the right-wing United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, an organization responsible for cocaine trafficking and mass murder, have been lifted until Dec. 15 so they can travel the country to coordinate the disarmament of 3,000 fighters as part of negotiations with President Alvaro Uribe's government. The plan is to demobilize the fighters by the end of the year, the first major step toward the eventual disarmament of 15,000. The safe-conduct passes were given to Salvatore Mancuso, who has been convicted in absentia for murder and is wanted in the United States for cocaine trafficking, and two other leaders, Ivan Roberto Duque and Ever Veloza, who is known as Hernan Hernandez.

Israeli news reports said the market was expected to reopen today. The strike was called after contract negotiations stalled over who would arbitrate a dispute about seniority benefits, the Haaretz daily said. * Malaysia's largest commercial bank, Malayan Banking, plans to provide property and equities trust funds next year, the executive director, Ahmad Mohd Don, said. He said the property trust fund, to be started in June, would be managed by a subsidiary of the bank. Details of the equities fund are still being worked out. ''We have to develop new financial instruments to enlarge our base,'' he said. * Uganda devalued its currency by 10 percent and raised fuel prices. The state-run Radio Uganda said the official rate of exchange had been raised to 165 shillings per dollar from 150. Finance Minister Crispus Kiyonga issued a statement announcing fuel price rises of up to 60 percent. Uganda implemented a much larger devaluation in July, when the official exchange rate was raised to 150 shillings a dollar from 60. Economists said the most recent devaluation was part of Government efforts to narrow the gap between official and black market exchange rates in accordance with an International Monetary Fund economic adjustment program. The dollar was changing hands at 495 to 500 shillings on Kampala's thriving black market before the devaluation was announced. Mr. Kiyonga said the economy had performed quite well since a first round of I.M.F.-prescribed measures were implemented in a budget in July.

If Phil Mickelson could not win the United States Open, a good many New Yorkers seemed to want Colin Montgomerie to succeed. The good vibrations for Montgomerie, a recalcitrant Scot, started on the practice range before the final round Sunday when a few fans yelled in unison, ''Good luck Monty!'' Montgomerie, a European tour heavyweight who has never won in the United States, turned around and acknowledged the good cheer with a smile. The crowd was still very much behind Montgomerie when he reached the 18th hole tied with Mickelson for the lead at four-over par. Their cheers would turn to groans when Montgomerie's second shot landed in deep rough short of the green. He chipped to 30 feet and then three putted for a double-bogey six and a final-round score of 71. He finished tied for second with Mickelson and Jim Furyk at six-over par. It was the 42-year-old Montgomerie's third runner-up finish at the Open. He was second in 1994 and 1997. ''You wonder sometimes why you put yourself through this,'' said Montgomerie, who was playing in his 100th tournament in the United States. He added, ''At my age, I've got to think positively. I'm 43 next week and it's nice I can come back to this tournament and do well again, and I look forward to coming back here again next year and try another U.S. Open disaster.'' Montgomerie then laughed, which seemed a sign that he is mellowing with age. So was the fact that he was more philosophical than frustrated when talking about another missed Open opportunity. ''This is the first time that I've really messed up,'' he said. ''Other chances I've had, other players have done very well.'' He added, ''That's O.K. You're entitled to a couple of mess-ups along the way.'' OGILVY LOST IN SIDESHOW -- Geoff Ogilvy had to win the United States Open to get any attention. He was paired in the final round with Ian Poulter, who showed up Sunday looking like a stick of Bazooka Bubble Gum. Poulter's pink shirt, pink pants and Pepto Bismol-pink golf bag elicited more reaction from the gallery on the front nine than Ogilvy's red numbers. When Poulter and the 29-year-old Ogilvy arrived at the par-4 eighth green, a fan yelled to Poulter, ''Does your husband play?'' Poulter produced a quick retort that sent a wave of laughter through the greenside bunker. There was not so much as a shout-out for Ogilvy, who at that point was two-under-par for the day and the leader at one-over-par for the tournament. It was like that on every hole, with The Pink Poulter being greeted by wolf whistles, smooching sounds and a version of ''The Pink Panther'' theme song. The crowd quips ran the gamut from the silly (''Poulter, nice pants. It's Father's Day, not Mother's Day.'' And, ''Where's your purse?'') to the supportive (''Go Ian: real men wear pink!''). Poulter's get-up was so colorful, nobody seemed to notice that Ogilvy was making a charge. ''It was almost like he was a little sideshow to Poulter,'' said Gus Seebeck, the general manager of the Australasian PGA Tour who followed the Ogilvy-Poulter group. ''Even after those two birdies, I didn't think he was getting necessarily any more attention from the crowds.'' A TEAM EFFORT -- Geoff Ogilvy has had the same caddie, Alastair Matheson, since he became a full-time member of the PGA Tour in 2001. After Ogilvy won the Match Play Championship in February, he said of Matheson, ''If he's not the best caddie in the world, then he's right up there.'' He added, ''He's got a better understanding of golf than I do.'' Their hale relationship appeared to hit a rough patch during Saturday's third round. On the par-5 12th, Matheson talked Ogilvy into laying up because the pin location made going for the green in two a low-risk play. Ogilvy did as Matheson said but did not seem happy about it. He made a par on that hole but made bogeys on the next two and looked visibly out of sorts. Gus Seebeck said he asked Ogilvy about it after the round and Ogilvy told him he was not mad at Matheson, he was peeved at the pin placement. Whatever, Ogilvy and Matheson were clearly on the same wavelength Sunday, with Ogilvy deferring to Matheson whenever a question arose about club selection and distance. WINNER STEALS THE HEADLINES -- Until Phil Mickelson's messy finish made Geoff Ogilvy the first Australian to win the United States Open in 25 years, the biggest sporting news Down Under was Australia's 2-0 loss Sunday to Brazil, the prohibitive favorite, at the World Cup. ''This is about the only thing in world sport that could knock Australia's World Cup game against Brazil off the front cover,'' Gus Seebeck said. GOLF: NOTEBOOK
Eddie Griffin paced the sideline, fiddled with his new practice jersey and rubbed his goatee as if he had just grown it last week. Later, he would say that he felt like a kid on his first day of school. And that is exactly how Griffin appeared to his new coaches and teammates, who seemed to be expecting a weathered veteran, hardened by suspensions and criminal charges. When Nets Coach Byron Scott walked into the practice facility Thursday, he took one look at the baby-faced Griffin and could not believe the contrasting image between the 21-year-old in front of him and the player he had heard so much about. ''When I first came out, I didn't know who he was,'' Scott said. ''I got a little closer and said, 'That's Eddie.' He just looked so young. I forgot he's only 21 years old.'' His age belies his past. Griffin is facing charges in Houston for felony assault and misdemeanor drug possession. He is accused of punching his girlfriend and firing a gun in her direction in October; he was charged with marijuana possession in April. He has two hearings Jan. 20 in Houston and is under a court-ordered curfew. Yet after the Rockets released Griffin last month, the Nets pursued him as if he were a prodigal son, and they embraced him as such Thursday. After his first workout, Griffin said he had not played competitive basketball in almost three months, was only 60 percent to 70 percent in shape and would need a few weeks to regain full strength. The Nets are more optimistic. Scott indicated that Griffin would not have to go on the injured list, that he would be with the team starting Friday night in Philadelphia, and that he could play right away if necessary. Because the Nets do not want to rush him, he will probably not get into a game for at least a week. For now, Griffin appears most concerned about meshing with a team whose personality runs counter to his own. Griffin is admittedly introverted and anxious, and the Nets are a raucous group. During his first practice, Griffin shyly introduced himself to his new teammates, and they loudly introduced themselves back. Griffin underwent treatment for substance abuse and depression in Houston and Nets officials have been in contact with his doctors to arrange any additional treatment in New Jersey. But the team could play the most important role in Griffin's rehabilitation. ''We need to make sure this kid is taken care of on and off the court,'' Scott said. ''The guys were tremendously helpful talking to him and letting him know where to be. He's going to feel a connection because this team is behind him and we're going to take him under our wing. Basketball is the least of our worries with Eddie.'' Still, basketball is why they signed him to a guaranteed contract worth about $400,000, the league minimum, taking a chance on Griffin, a talented 6-foot-10 forward who punched a teammate in high school and another one at Seton Hall. ''We have to try to make him feel comfortable,'' said Kenyon Martin. ''I wanted to explain to him how we're always laughing. I think that will make him relax. Hopefully, we'll make it easier for him.'' PRO BASKETBALL

LEAD: Officials of the leading industrial countries sought here today to dispel speculation about a coordinated move toward a substantial increase in world interest rates because of signs of rising inflation. Officials of the leading industrial countries sought here today to dispel speculation about a coordinated move toward a substantial increase in world interest rates because of signs of rising inflation. But an American official indicated that the Reagan Administration would not object to a small increase in West German rates. ''There is room for a small technical increase in their rates,'' said the official, who declind to be identified. German rate increases last summer and fall provoked fear in the Administration then that American rates would have to rise, too, perhaps leading to a slowing of the American economy as it approached an election year. This time, however, the offical said, American rates have risen a bit this year, while German rates have not risen as much. ''But,'' the official added, ''nobody's saying a tightening of money is going on.'' Suspicion of a rise in rates coordinated by the leaders of the seven nations attending the economic summit conference has arisen in recent days in world financial markets. In the United States credit markets, analysts said they expect rates to rise modestly in the coming weeks.  [ Page D1. ]  But the need to raise rates to cool off economic expansion and keep the inflation rate low was not considered a high priority at the summit meeting, officials said. ''We are not in a position to say that economic indicators show us that inflation is a real danger,'' Toyoo Gyohten, Japan's deputy minister of finance for international affairs, said after a meeting he attended with the finance ministers of the seven summit countries. No Sense of Urgency ''Several ministers certainly mentioned this inflation,'' he told reporters at a briefing. ''My general impression was that there was no sense of urgency that the inflation situation has reached a level that requires changes in policy'' like raising interest rates. The generally relaxed atmosphere here was dampened, in particular, after reports from Frankfurt that the West German central bank is preparing an increase in rates to arrest a slight rise in inflation. But Friedhelm Ost, chief spokesman for the West German Government, said the Bundesbank will be guided by the markets in any future decisions on interest rates, Reuters reported today. He spoke with reporters after a meeting between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain. Mr. Ost said interest rates had not been discussed by the two leaders. Reports of Growth Speculation that rate increases might come as soon as this week followed reports last week that the Japanese economy had grown unusually fast in the first quarter this year and that there had been a rise in consumer prices in Britain. British officials here also ruled out any coordinated increase in interest rates. No one here has denied that rates might rise and that the Federal Reserve might raise rates in the United States to hold the exchange rate of the dollar at the current level. But officials go out of their way to emphasize that any increases would be fractional and based solely on the special economic circumstances in individual countries.

LEAD: A Democratic Senator who opposes early deployment of missile defenses in space said today that he might try to prohibit any spending in 1988 on research that would violate a strict interpretation of the 1972 ABM treaty limiting tests of such technologies. A Democratic Senator who opposes early deployment of missile defenses in space said today that he might try to prohibit any spending in 1988 on research that would violate a strict interpretation of the 1972 ABM treaty limiting tests of such technologies. The Senator, J. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat who sits on the Appropriations Committee, said that ''unless persuaded otherwise'' he would introduce such an amendment to the bill that provides money for next year's Pentagon programs. By limiting research money, the amendment would go further than other legislative efforts in maintaining the status of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Senator Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat, has introduced a resolution expressing support for strict adherence to the treaty, but it is not clear that his measure would be legally binding. The Administration has been criticized by Senate Democrats for seeking a broad interpretation of the ABM treaty that would permit extensive testing. Measures to limit tests are expected to win substantial support in both houses of Congress, and a restriction on next year's budget could become a precedent for later years. Testimony by Abrahamson At a hearing today before the Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee, Lieut. Gen. James A. Abrahamson, director of the missile defense program, said the research was not likely to involve tests before 1989 that would be precluded by the strict reading of the treaty. ''That is the way the budgets were put together, and that is the way the plans were laid out,'' he said, when asked whether money sought for 1987 and 1988 would be spent within the treaty's strict bounds. ''The answer is, yes, sir.'' General Abrahamson said the Pentagon had not yet completed studies showing when prohibited tests would become necessary. He said he would object to any legislation that prevented his office from planning experiments under a broader interpretation. The Reagan Administration has said since 1985 that a correct interpretation of the treaty would permit tests of weapons using novel technologies. It has agreed for the time being to abide by a narrower interpretation. The issue has come to dominate the arms control debate, as Democratic Senators, including Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, have disputed the Administration's view of the treaty. General Abrahamson said today that research was being delayed and made more costly because of the treaty's strictures. He said that an experimental satellite to track ballistic missiles during their ascent would be designed and tested without the full capabilities that would have to be installed for an operational missile defense system. By limiting the tests, he said, the Pentagon would avoid violating the treaty as strictly defined. Need for $1 Billion More If the Administration adopted the broad interpretation, General Abrahamson said, roughly $1 billion more would have to be spent to expand the test plan for the satellite. On Wednesday, the Pentagon awarded contracts for development of the satellite, known as the Boost Surveillance and Tracking System, to two contractors, the Grumman Corporation and the Lockheed Corporation. Each concern won a contract worth $304 million. Seated beside a six-foot model of an antimissile rocket meant to be based in space, General Abrahamson told the committee that ''the balance is shifting'' toward adopting the broader view of the treaty so that space weapons could be fully tested. General Abrahamson said that a preliminary deployment of interceptors in space, along with other weapons and related equipment, might be fielded beginning in 1994 for $40 billion to $60 billion. It was the first time that a Pentagon official has estimated the cost of an initial defense, although the general conceded that his estimate was not very reliable.
LEAD: The matronly woman from Nazareth with a map labeled Palestine embroidered on her homemade robe had a story to tell, and so, too, did the man in the brown business suit from Stockholm - tales of one-way tickets to exile, passports to unending Diaspora. The matronly woman from Nazareth with a map labeled Palestine embroidered on her homemade robe had a story to tell, and so, too, did the man in the brown business suit from Stockholm - tales of one-way tickets to exile, passports to unending Diaspora. Then there was the military commander from south Lebanon, clad in a dark-blue blazer instead of his usual camouflage fatigues, who kept his tales to himself. In the lobbies of the Club des Pins tourist village where the Palestine National Council is meeting, it seems about as exotic as a convention of Detroit automakers, without the hoopla. People wear badges setting out name and status. People lobby and press causes. They huddle and caucus in a decision-making process that resembles a kind of osmosis. Lights burn late in the villas where the P.L.O.'s leaders are housed. Deals are struck or not struck. The hundreds of delegates debate and argue what their leaders have decided, seeking, if not consensus, then a majority view. Declaration of Independence The main business here was a declaration of independence for the Israeli-occupied territories and a new political program intended to show the Palestinians as the people who want peace, not war or terror. But the sideshows have their significance, too, reminding those who might forget of what ignited the wars and of the emotions behind them. People like Khaled Faham have been pondering when they will ever go back to what they see as home, as if a sustaining hope had perished. These days, he said, he lives in Stockholm, a businessman exiled from the land he has taught his children to see as home. But home, in the old days, was the coastal city of Haifa, from which his family fled in 1948. ''I come from Haifa,'' he said. ''To me, I'm not getting anything out of this. Now I have to change my mentality and that of my children.'' He seemed to concede that any Palestinian state declared here would never encompass Haifa, although the P.L.O.'s charter still insists on the right of Palestinians to return whence they came. Zakhir Chamet, from Nazareth, came to the session today in a striking white robe, stitched with emblems and slogans and a map of Palestine. She had been jailed by the Israelis for 14 years - she would not say why - and had come here in 1984 as part of a prisoner exchange. But that had left her family divided. Her three daughters were with her here, two sons were in Israel. Dream of Reunification The idea of a family reunification, she said, seemed a distant dream. Throughout the world, those who count themselves Palestinian number five million. Of those, 1.7 million live under Israeli administration, so many share her sense of a forfeited homeland to which return has been made impossible. Maneuvering intrudes on an organization jealous of its independence among Arab states that generally wish to steer it. The P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, has recently seemed to befriend President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, leader of a land once reviled by many Arabs for its 1979 peace with Israel. But when the council meeting opened here two days ago, one guest was Khaled Abdel Nasser, the son of the late Egyptian leader. Mr. Nasser is on trial in Egypt in absentia on treason charges. ''We wanted to send a signal,'' a P.L.O. official said, ''that we are in no one's pocket, and that we support the democratic opposition in Egypt.'' By contrast, the meeting opened with fulsome praise of Algeria's President, Chadli Benjedid, the host. No one, out of courtesy, mentioned the riots.

This last year the paper is more concerned with the clients looking for bargains, inexpensive walkups and apparently little comforts. Gone is the stuff that dreams are made of!

Karl Linnas, the Estonian deported from the United States last month and facing a death sentence passed by a Soviet court 25 years ago for war crimes, has asked the Estonian Supreme Court to pardon him, the Soviet press agency Tass reported today. Tass quoted Karl Kimmel, an Estonian prosecutor who took part in the 1962 prosecution in absentia of Mr. Linnas, as saying the appeal for a pardon was the only document received thus far from Mr. Linnas. The appeal cited the passage of more than 40 years since the actions at issue, Tass said. Mr. Linnas, 67 years old, who worked as a land surveyor in Greenlawn, L.I., has had two meetings with his court-appointed lawyer since his deportation and arrival in Estonia on April 21. He has been accused of war crimes commited while he helped run two concentration camps in his native city of Tartu in Estonia.

A chastened President Bush now concedes that he hasn't done enough in the fight against AIDS, and says he's ready "to go the extra mile." Those are welcome words from a man whose listless leadership on AIDS was thrown into sharp relief by Magic Johnson's bold disclosure that he was infected with the virus. But if Mr. Bush is serious, he'll need to transform the way his Administration views the epidemic. It's not enough to ask Magic Johnson to become a member of The National Commission on AIDS, which the President did yesterday. True, that's an important gesture. Mr. Johnson holds special significance to Americans, particularly young blacks, the group among whom the epidemic is spreading the fastest. Beyond that, the President must also pay some attention to the commission's report, which met with a muted response in the White House when it was released two months ago. The report criticized the President for rarely speaking out on AIDS. The commission also pointed out deadly flaws in the Government's treatment and prevention strategy. The Government urges infected people who are not yet ill to take drugs to delay the onset of the disease. But there are too few research, counseling or testing programs to handle the load, and too little health insurance to pay for it. Furthermore, intravenous drug users are now the major source of infection in some sections of the country; they spread the virus to other addicts by sharing needles, or to non-addicted partners through sexual intercourse. But treatment that would make them drug-free is still in short supply. Frank discussion of sexual practices is the only proven way to change risky sexual conduct. Yet the Government recently killed two studies of sexual behavior, one because of explicit questions. This prudish stance blunts the most powerful tool we have against the disease. Vice President Dan Quayle symbolizes another Administration blind spot. Last weekend he said abstinence was the only way to stop sexual transmission of HIV. Today's teen-agers are sexually active on an unprecedented scale. Better to teach them to protect themselves than see them die. Mr. Bush can build on the dramatic focus that Magic Johnson has given the AIDS problem. The methods are clearly at hand. All the President has to do is lead.
He played against Mickey Mantle and with Jackie Robinson, Sandy Koufax and the 1962 Mets, managed Dave Winfield and Carl Yastrzemski, watched Bucky Dent's fly ball hit the net above the Green Monster at Fenway Park. And he was there when Charlie Hayes caught the pop-up to end the 1996 World Series. Don Zimmer is like Dustin Hoffman's character in the movie ''Little Big Man,'' similar to Tom Hanks's character in ''Forrest Gump'': he seems to have been everywhere and seen everything in his half a century in professional baseball. This year, the Yankees' bench coach is wearing No. 50 to commemorate his tenure. Zimmer's favorite and most devastating moments are intertwined. In 1978, he was the manager of the Boston Red Sox, a team that lost a 14 1/2-game lead to the Yankees, then made a mad rush at season's end to force the one-game playoff that lives in the hearts of Red Sox and Yankee fans. To get to that game on that Monday in October, Zimmer said, was his greatest moment. Two great rivals with great players, playing great baseball at the end of the season, the pressure monumental, the stakes extraordinary. Zimmer said he once had a friend who managed an expansion team, and in a private moment, this friend said he felt he was in a perfect situation, with a multiyear contract and no expectations for success. Zimmer was stunned. ''There was pressure in Boston, and that was thrilling,'' he said. ''I'd rather be in that situation any time.'' The Red Sox led, 2-0, when Dent came to bat in the seventh inning, two runners on. Usually, October days in Boston are cool, fly balls don't carry well. This particular day, Zimmer remembered, ''was a beautiful day, about 70 degrees, the wind was drifting out toward right.'' When Dent, swinging with his hands choked up on the bat, hit Mike Torrez's pitch, Zimmer remembers thinking, ''Good, that's an out, no problem.'' Then he saw Yastrzemski drifting back, looking up, until the ball rippled the net above the fence. Zimmer is surrounded here by members of that 1978 Yankee team who are now working for the Yankees -- Reggie Jackson, Goose Gossage, Chris Chambliss, Mickey Rivers, all the core players other than Thurman Munson and Dent. ''And they show that tape about four times a day at Yankee Stadium,'' Zimmer said. Does he turn around when the videotape is replayed? ''I watch it,'' Zimmer said, probably still wondering how Dent's fly ball carried. When relating some of his 50-year favorites, Zimmer does not choose from only one generation of ballplayers. Rather, he selects those he played against as well as those playing now. Koufax was the best pitcher he saw for a five-year period, but if the standard of time is lengthened, he said, it's Atlanta's Greg Maddux. Some of Zimmer's other superlatives: Most courageous player -- ''Jim Abbott. To pitch with one hand -- how can you have more courage than that?'' Best change in the game -- ''Free agency for the players, the right for them to move around.'' Worst change in the game -- guaranteed contracts. Zimmer believes that in some cases, the security naturally diminishes a player's compulsion for performance. Zimmer said, ''Gene Mauch once made a statement, 'Give me 25 guys in the last year of their contracts.' '' Best overall player -- Willie Mays. ''He just could do everything,'' Zimmer said. Best defensive player -- Roberto Clemente. ''But, gosh, there have been a lot of great ones,'' Zimmer said. ''Roy McMillan, he was terrific. How could you not pick a guy like Ken Griffey Jr.?'' Best pure hitter -- Henry Aaron, baseball's career home run leader. Player with best sense of humor -- Moe Drabowsky, a pitcher who spent much of his career with the Baltimore Orioles. ''He was always doing something, setting hot foots, doing something to aggravate people,'' Zimmer said, smiling. A player who would have been a star if not for an injury -- Karl Spooner, who pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1954 and 1955. ''You ask anyone who saw him,'' Zimmer said, ''and they say he would've been another Koufax. Big left-hander, nice easy motion until he released the ball -- boom! Great curveball.'' At the end of the 1954 season, Spooner pitched in two games, won both with complete games, allowing no runs, walking 6 and striking out 27. ''The next year, he hurt his shoulder, and the next time I saw him he had a scar from here to there,'' said Zimmer, touching his shoulder and running a finger down to his elbow. Best way to survive in baseball for 50 years -- ''You've got to be lucky,'' Zimmer said. INSIDE PITCH HIDEKI IRABU played catch Thursday, tossing lightly 61 times without pain in his right elbow. If he feels all right on Friday, he will throw in the bullpen in Lakeland, Fla., before the Yankees' exhibition against Detroit, in preparation for a possible start against San Diego State on Monday. Should Irabu clear these hurdles, he will start against Oakland on April 5. . . . CHILI DAVIS, the designated hitter, is nursing a groin strain. There is a chance he will miss the season opener Wednesday, but the injury is not considered serious. . . . JOE TORRE said he will tell his three left fielders -- DARRYL STRAWBERRY, TIM RAINES and CHAD CURTIS -- how he intends to use them. It is likely that Strawberry will platoon against right-handed pitchers, but Torre must decide whether to play Curtis or Raines against left-handers. . . . Right-hander DANNY RIOS, placed on waivers this week to make room for ORLANDO HERNANDEZ, was claimed by the Kansas City Royals. BASEBALL
Sara Pearson/Patrik Widrig and Company  Bessie Schonberg Theater Large crates dominated the stage when Sara Pearson/Patrik Widrig and Company presented "Do You Remember?" on Wednesday night. Sometimes the crates in this hourlong production, designed by Carlo Adinolfi, were simply solid objects to dance on and around. At other times they symbolized friendly and hostile powers. Stagehands frequently moved the crates about, bringing them together to form a single huge platform, only to separate them or stand them on end. Each shift of position affected the choreography created by Ms. Pearson with the assistance of Mr. Widrig. Dancers bounced and sprawled on the crates and kept jumping off and over them to a collage of taped music. Although such sequences were inventive, they occasionally seemed nothing more than examples of the self-consciously clever things bright choreographers can do with props. Then, suddenly, the objects took on new meanings. These transformations occurred when Marcela Ortiz de Zarate Broughton, a member of the company, began to reminisce about fleeing her native Chile after the military coup there in 1973. She spoke about her philosophically heterogeneous relatives, who included atheists, Communists and Roman Catholics, and about living in exile. As she did so, the crates were no longer just crates. There were moments when the dancers treated them as shelters or islands of refuge. But without warning, the crates turned into walls to scale and barriers blocking escape. They also came to resemble prison cells. The theatrical ingenuity of "Do You Remember?" ultimately called attention to a whole moral and political world outside the theater. JACK ANDERSON
LEAD: A ONCE-SMALL networking group for middle-management women that started in Stamford seven years ago now has become so successful that over 60 percent of its 250 members earn more than $50,000 a year and close to one in five tops $90,000. A ONCE-SMALL networking group for middle-management women that started in Stamford seven years ago now has become so successful that over 60 percent of its 250 members earn more than $50,000 a year and close to one in five tops $90,000. Women in Management, of Fairfield and Westchester Counties, is now considered so critical to success that young women just of college see it as the ideal way to meet the top local people in their fields rather than as a support group of peers, as was the case at the beginning, its members say. For the same reason, an increasing number of businessmen attend the public gatherings of the group. The programs have increased as well, to once or twice a week from once a month. The change was noted by members and guests at the seventh Annual Recognition Dinner at the Sheraton Stamford Hotel last Monday - a gathering that drew more than 600 people, about 20 percent of whom were men. The change was also apparent in the caliber of the corporations that sponsored tables for the evening, the roster of names reading like a list of blue-chip stocks. Among them were A.T.&T., Avco Lyncoming, the Champion International Corporation, Clairol, General Electric, GTE, the Olin Corporation, Richardson-Vicks, the Union Carbide Corporation, Waldenbooks and the Xerox Corporation. The success of many of the group's members has also had a fundamental impact upon the focus of the organization. ''We have become much more of a professional resource for each other,'' said Nicki Brown, first vice president of Women in Management and the president and chief executive office of the newly established Wilton Bank. For example, she said she had been able to call upon members for the specific expertise of each while setting up the bank over the past year. ''You get an honest opinion from friends like that, not just what people think you want to hear,'' she said. Much of that strength, noted Linda C. Jones, the president of Women in Management and an accountant, seems to have come from the fact that it is an interdisciplinary group with an ever-increasing diversity of backgrounds. Members now include executives in marketing and finance, lawyers, engineers, developers and manufacturers. Moreover, a third of those women are now self-employed or entrepreneurs running their own small companies, according to a survey of the membership completed a year ago. At the beginning, all the members -there were about 30 - were employed by corporations. The organization's growth and the successes of its members have had an effect on the nature of the programs - a shift that may be a harbinger of the way other women's professional groups may evolve. In place of some of the original discrimination issues, there are seminars on investments and taxes and even spinoff enterprises. An investment series early last winter, for example, led about 60 members to form a real-estate investment pool to puchase property in Connecticut. The organization has also begun to deal more decisively with the wider problems faced by women in the executive suite. For instance, a subcommittee called Working Mothers of WIM has formed a referral network for child- and household care. Another subcommittee, Single Members of WIM, sets up social events for women who must deal with the loneliness of single life. The new-found confidence and status of many of the women has enabled them to take a fresh look at their involvement in the community. ''When you are hungry you can't give to other people so easily,'' said Pamela Yardis, a public-relations director at Harper & Row in New York City. ''Now we have more of a chance.'' The volunteerism, however, is not a replay of the 1950's, when women were used to ''stuff envelopes and cook the hot dogs,'' said Ms. Yardis. Rather, the group is offering its expertise to organizations. For example, Ms. Brown, the banker, has become the treasurer of the Wilton Red Cross and the Wilton Y.M.C.A. Other members are providing business acumen for small child-care agencies in Stamford. That confidence is affecting ways in which the women handle their business commitments. Jo Shute, who is 34 years old - most of the members are in their late 30's to 50's - and the manager of new business development at the Norwalk offices of the James River Corporation, a paper concern, brought her 3-month-old daughter to the dinner. ''I only have time to see Christina in the evening,'' said Ms. Shute, as she cradled the baby in her right arm and, in the other, hugged a handbag from which peeped a feeding bottle. ''And I didn't see it as out of place to bring her along. There's more of an acceptance of diversity. You do what works for you.'' The possible business benefits of the male corporate leaders associating with the group was summed up by John Murphy, executive vice president of Michael Simon Associates, an outplacement concern in Mount Kisko, N.Y. ''It's not only the higher-level men who are being laid off in this period of mergers and cutting back,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''Lots of the women in this room are losing their positions, too. We want to be among those who assist them.'' But there are still challenges. Ruth Lyon, a corporate-image consultant from Westport, says the time has come for successful women to take a more active role in promoting women who are starting out. ''Instead of pulling up the ladder behind us, we should say, 'I'm going to bring someone with me.' A group like WIM is ideal for that.''
ADD one specific set of credentials to the long list of desirable qualities in a fund manager. That is C.F.A., or chartered financial analyst. Stock fund managers with that designation have turned in superior performance, according to a study by Ravi Shukla and Sandeep Singh, assistant professors of finance at Syracuse University and the State University of New York at Brockport, respectively. In an article in the Financial Analysts Journal, the academics said they examined the returns of 223 stock funds that kept the same managers from July 1988 through June 1993. After breaking the funds into two groups, they found that the funds run by chartered financial analysts had higher returns than the others. The difference was most pronounced among aggressive-growth funds. To become a chartered financial analyst, money managers must pass three tests on securities, accounting and similar matters. Roughly half the people who take the tests pass the first two parts, and three-quarters pass the final one. There were 28,000 candidates this year, up from 7,100 in 1987. To find information about a manager's education and training, check the fund prospectus or call the fund company. Getting Together The merger pace is picking up. The Twentieth Century group, whose speciality is stock funds, is acquiring Benham Management International, a group that specializes in bond funds and is based in Mountain View, Calif. The deal needs the approval of Benham's shareholders. The combined group would manage $37 billion in more than 50 funds, all sold without sales charges. The Colonial Group, Boston, is merging with Liberty Financial Companies, also of Boston, which manages 22 funds, many under the Stein Roe name. United Asset Management picked up tiny but powerful Pilgrim Baxter & Associates, which runs PBHG Growth and PBHG Emerging Growth. Breather for Bonds? With the dollar dipping to new lows practically every day, should bond buyers worry? Though the dollar is not necessarily healthy for the long term, the worries about its condition are overblown, said William H. Gross, an expert on fixed-income investing with the Pimco family of funds. Because Americans don't save enough, he said, the country relies on the savings of strangers, meaning long-term problems. But the Federal Reserve will probably sit tight for some time rather than raise interest rates further. "It's the perfect circumstance for a money manager who believes that bonds won't go up much, won't go down much, but will earn an attractive coupon along the way," he said. Change at Fidelity Jeffrey Ubben resigned as manager of the $4 billion Fidelity Value fund to join Richard C. Blum & Associates, an investment firm in San Francisco.

LEAD: America has devised many new media for advertising, including cable television, auto bumpers, skywriters at the beach and blimps at the ballpark. Of them all, the most intriguing may be the human torso, medium for message T-shirts. America has devised many new media for advertising, including cable television, auto bumpers, skywriters at the beach and blimps at the ballpark. Of them all, the most intriguing may be the human torso, medium for message T-shirts. The messages parade past in endless variety. Some classics bear only a picture of Mickey Mouse or the Beatles or Colette. Some advertise trade names: Nike, Reebok, Cheerios. Some offer canned wisecracks like: ''I got this T-shirt in New York for My Wife. Good Trade.'' Others echo the old anti-war days with bitter, dated messages like: ''Join the Army. Visit strange and exotic places. Meet fascinating people. And kill them.'' Many provide a forum for name- and place-dropping. It's common to see the brown-and-gold legend, ''Hard Rock Cafe.'' A rarer one, reading ''Hard Rock Cafe/London'' makes a stronger impression. That very place-name distinction may help explain why so many Americans eagerly turn themselves into billboards. We are advertising our taste, our humor, our exclusivity - often with surprising degrees of sophistication. ''Ski Aspen'' implies a somewhat upscale vacation - but ''Aspen Fishing Lodge'' implies something considerably higher on the scale. A little girl bears the message: ''My parents went to Puerto Rico and all they got me was this lousy T-shirt.'' A young man's shirt says, ''The Brenchley Arms, Miraflores, Lima, Peru, South America,'' denoting a far more discriminating traveler. People who wear shirts proclaiming ''Bud'' convey a simple macho swagger. People who wear the blue-and-gold logo of Corona, the Mexican beer, may be flaunting their chic. People whose shirts say ''Anchor Steam Beer, San Francisco'' make a statement about exclusivity. But whatever the precise motive may be, what all the T-shirt message wearers seem to have in common is a need, even a poignant yearning, to be noticed. Notice my taste, the shirts proclaim. Notice my sense of humor, my sophistication, my college. Above all, notice me! Which makes all the more subtle the message conveyed by a young man seen running around the Central Park reservoir last weekend. His plain white T-shirt said absolutely nothing.
Tiptoeing through the thickets of Britain's ambiguous relationship with Europe, the Government revived its support for the euro single currency today without venturing away from its caution about joining. Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, chose a business audience in Japan -- a major source of investment in Britain -- to laud the eight-month-old currency as a positive economic force. ''It's too early to reach a firm view,'' Mr. Cook said, ''but already there are signs that the euro is bringing a new strength to the economies that are part of it.'' Anywhere else, such remarks might be depicted as innocuous. But the euro is a deeply divisive issue here, and the Labor Government is worried that it could forfeit its broad electoral support by pushing British voters too fast toward joining it. Britain remained on the sidelines when the euro was introduced last January, saying it would consider joining only if economic conditions seemed propitious and only if British voters approved the idea in a referendum after the next general election, which must be held in May 2002 at the latest. Since then, the Government's apparent support for the idea has been jolted, first by European parliamentary elections in June, when the Conservative opposition scored surprising gains with an anti-euro ticket, and by what seem to be stubborn economic differences between the Continent and Britain. Most significantly, British benchmark interest rates are twice as high as those in the countries that use the euro. Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, has said the economic gap would make British membership risky. Even though Mr. Cook's remarks in Tokyo seemed almost hesitant, skeptics on the euro immediately labeled them extremist. Stuart Gulleford, a spokesman for the Euroskeptic Campaign for an Independent Britain, which has support from people in both Labor and the Conservative opposition, said the minister's comments showed a ''dogmatic commitment to the abolition of the pound.'' Offsetting domestic opposition, though, Britain faces pressure from euro members to join if it is to maintain European influence, while foreign investors interested in Britain as a base for the wider European market have raised questions about Prime Minister Tony Blair's intentions. ''I know that when you look at Britain as a place for investment, you're not just sizing up Britain on its own,'' Mr. Cook told the Japanese business leaders. ''You're also looking at Britain's place in Europe.'' He added, ''Today, I give you a guarantee that under Tony Blair, Britain's place in Europe is secure and the access of business to that market is secure.'' His remarks had been widely forecast in today's British newspapers and several commentators called them a significant step toward joining the euro because Mr. Cook focused on the currency's perceived successes rather than on its downward drift on foreign exchange markets. But his comments fell short of abandoning Britain's key conditions for membership. ''I assure you that if the euro proves a stable, successful currency, Tony Blair's Government will make sure that Britain is ready to take part, subject to the support of the British people in a referendum,'' Mr. Cook said. ''If the euro brings benefit to its members, we will not let Britain lose out by staying out.'' The markets showed little reaction. The euro was at 0.6593 pence against the pound, compared with 0.6616 pence on Friday. Against the dollar, the euro was at $1.0576, compared with $1.0612 on Friday. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
The private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners is delving deeper into the talent management business, providing the financing for a deal that unites two of the music industry's best-known artist representatives, according to music executives involved in the discussions. As part of the deal, the talent managers, Irving Azoff and Howard Kaufman, will create a new Front Line Management, a company with a roster of clients that includes the Eagles, Christina Aguilera and Jimmy Buffett. With the Lee investment, whose terms have not been disclosed, the managers are looking to expand by adding a number of other artist representatives. The new company is expected to include, the executives said, a traditional talent-management operation and a second unit that would sell artist-related services including distribution, merchandising, fan-club operation and ticketing. The deal also reunites Mr. Azoff and Mr. Kaufman, who were partners in the original Front Line management firm in the mid-1970's. Mr. Azoff left to become president of MCA Records in 1983, and Mr. Kaufman created a talent management company, HK Management. It is not the first time the Lee company has invested in the talent side of the music industry. In September, Lee agreed to buy an equity stake in another talent management company, the Firm, whose clients include Linkin Park, Cameron Diaz and Clay Aiken. Lee also owns a significant stake in the Warner Music Group. Mr. Azoff, Mr. Kaufman and the Lee company could not be reached for comment.
The commencements are largely over, the honorary degrees dispensed. Most organizations are winding down their year's activities, and still honors are being presented for all sorts of accomplishments. The New York Civil Liberties Union, for example, is waiting until June 29 to present its 1994 Florina Lasker Civil Liberties Award to the Weavers, the folk singing group. In a ceremony at the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park, HARRY BELAFONTE will present the award to the three surviving Weavers: PETE SEEGER, RONNIE GILBERT and FRED HELLERMAN and posthumously to Lee Hayes, who died in 1981. "For nearly half a century the Weavers folk singers have combatted racism and intolerance and promoted peace through their wonderful songs such as 'If I Had a Hammer,' 'Where Have All the Flowers Gone?' and 'Study War No More,' NORMAN SIEGEL, executive director of the organization, said the other day.

IF there was ever any question which was the kinder, gentler computer company -- Apple Computer or I.B.M. -- their respective handlings of the recent missteps at Intel and Microsoft should set aside all doubt. I.B.M. played pit bull, Apple pussycat. It doesn't necessarily mean that the people at Apple are fundamentally nicer -- just that they have their own good reasons for diplomacy. Recall recent events. Earlier this month, Intel thought it had all but put the Pentium chip difficulties behind it when the International Business Machines Corporation went for the jugular, turning an infrequent problem with long division into a far more serious problem for the chipmaker. By asserting that the Pentium might miscalculate every 24 days instead of every 27,000 years, I.B.M. all but forced Intel to reconsider its "we'll tell you if you need a new chip" policy and offer new Pentiums to all. Despite being Intel's biggest customer, I.B.M. plans eventually for its Power PC chip to compete directly with the Pentium. No sooner had Intel capitulated last Tuesday than Microsoft said -- yet again -- that its Windows 95 software operating system would be late. And lo, the I.B.M. publicist was almost immediately on the phone, pointing out what a blow Microsoft's delay would be to independent software developers, who, by the way, could ease their pain by producing programs for the 7 million or so users of I.B.M.'s software alternative, OS/2. The latest version of OS/ 2, dubbed Warp, is meant to compete with Windows. Since its introduction earlier this year, it has sold about 800,000 copies. During all this, where was Apple Computer Inc., the other natural beneficiary of problems at Microsoft and Intel? "Oh, we certainly can't comment on our competitors," Pam Miracle, an Apple spokeswoman, replied politely when asked if the company was boosting production of its non-Intel computers and non-Microsoft software in anticipation of increased consumer demand. Apple did, though, use the cover provided by Microsoft's news to confirm that its own new operating system, code-named Copland, would be late too. If Apple's reticence to taunt seemed quaint in comparison to I.B.M.'s brass-knuckles demeanor, some analysts thought it served Apple's long-term interests. "I think Apple is basically doing the right thing, staying on the side lines and not commenting," Guy Kawasaki, a columnist for MacWorld magazine, said. But while many analysts assigned an ulterior motive to I.B.M.'s pronouncements about Intel and Microsoft, Apple is actually in a much better position to benefit from any fear, uncertainty or doubt in the Windows-Intel (Wintel) world. I.B.M. will not ship a personal computer with the Power PC chip inside, or a version of OS/2 that can run on it, until the middle of next year. But Apple has already sold nearly 1 million Power PC versions of its Macintosh and continues to sell these Power Macs as fast as it can make them. Indeed, some analysts said Microsoft and Intel had just handed Apple its best opportunity yet to build its market share. "The derivative effect of all of this stuff is a slow, heavy curve ball over the middle of the plate for Apple," Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, said. Whether Apple is ready to hit that ball out of the park depends on where it's playing . In the consumer market, Apple is well positioned to ride the growth in multimedia computing -- the embellishment of computer text with graphics, audio and video. Nearly every review of multimedia software on Wintel personal computers mentions the difficulties of getting some programs to run without resetting the computer's internal switches or writing arcane instructions in operating system files. Such chores are almost non-existent in the Macintosh; the only glitch is an occasional software title that requires more memory than may be available. For small-business and home-office use, meanwhile, a mid-level Mac with the Claris Works integrated software package is a painless, inexpensive solution that meets most peoples' needs. But the Mac vs. Wintel debate becomes more complex in the corporate world, where the Macintosh has long suffered from the perception that it is a niche product, suited mainly for graphics and publishing. Like many stereotypes, this one has some basis in reality. The Mac was well-suited for graphics and publishing tasks like page layout long before Intel-based machines were. And in the early going, the Mac did lack comparable business-productivity tools, like spreadsheet or data base programs. (The less said about Lotus 1-2-3 or dBase for the Mac, now both defunct, the better.) The spreadsheet issue was laid to rest with Microsoft Excel, introduced in 1985 for the Mac, even before being available for Windows. On the data base front, there are powerful Macintosh programs, like 4th Dimension from Acius Inc. and Helix from the Odesta Corporation, which, probably because they come from small companies that do not advertise much, have gotten less recognition than they probably deserve. Microsoft, meanwhile, offers a Macintosh version of FoxBase, its version of the dBase data base programming language. And early next year, Oracle will ship Personal Oracle for the Power Mac, a user-friendly version of Oracle's data base management program that runs on mini-computers and mainframes. One long-standing weakness has been the dearth of software development tools for the Macintosh, compared with the Windows world. Such tools are used by the independent companies that create application programs for a given operating system. Many independent software developers have said they were able to write Power Mac programs to coincide with the new machine's release early this year only by using a programming tool called Code Warrior, from tiny Metrowerks in Austin, Tex. Even Claris, Apple's own software subsidiary, used Code Warrior to develop its Power Mac applications like Claris Works and the Macwrite Pro word processor. Again, Oracle plans to ride to the rescue next year, with a product currently code-named Project X, which is expected to ship in the second quarter of next year. Project X is a low-end, rapid development tool meant to compete with Microsoft's Visual Basic. But unlike Visual Basic, which runs only on Microsoft Windows, Oracle's Project X will also work with Apple Macintosh and I.B.M. OS/2 software. The Macintosh is also getting a helping hand in the corporate-computing market from the latest release of Novell Inc.'s Netware software, the most widely used operating system for networks of desktop computers. Though Netware has provided network access for Macintoshes for many years, those capabilities always came at an added cost -- a strong disincentive for a business office to use any Macs on a network of many Wintel PC's. But Netware 4.1, released two weeks ago, is not only 25 percent cheaper than Netware 4.0; it includes Netware for Macintosh for free. And the new version gives Macintosh users access to Netware's directory services, allowing them to communicate with anyone anywhere else on the network. All these developments, perhaps more than any perceived weakness in enemy camps, could nudge Apple's share of the computer market beyond its current 11 percent and closer to its goal of 20 percent. And, significantly, these developments have required cooperation from other nation-states within the computing world. No wonder then, that during the computer world's recent crises, while I.B.M. rattled sabers, Apple practiced diplomatic politesse.
LEAD: The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has decided to allow the Toledo Zoo to begin exhibiting two giant pandas on loan from China while zoo officials work to produce the required export papers, the service said today. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has decided to allow the Toledo Zoo to begin exhibiting two giant pandas on loan from China while zoo officials work to produce the required export papers, the service said today. Last week, the agency said the zoo would not be allowed to display the pandas until it could provide the original export permit. The zoo, which has scheduled to open the exhibit Tuesday, was given 10 days to come up with the documentation. David Klinger, a spokesman for the wildlife service, said today that lawyers for the zoo gave the service a copy of the Chinese export permit over the weekend and appear to be making a good-faith effort to deliver the original document. He said the zoo will still be required to provide the original by May 29. A zoo spokeswoman, Patty Napierala, said the exhibit will open at noon Tuesday as scheduled. The zoo has spent nearly $3 million in preparing to exhibit the pandas as part of Toledo's 150th anniversary celebration.

LEAD: More than three-quarters of the chief financial officers of the nation's largest non-financial corporations favor the repeal of a Federal banking law that separates commercial banking from securities underwriting, according to a survey conducted by the Senate Banking Committee and made available this week. More than three-quarters of the chief financial officers of the nation's largest non-financial corporations favor the repeal of a Federal banking law that separates commercial banking from securities underwriting, according to a survey conducted by the Senate Banking Committee and made available this week. In addition, almost 70 percent of these companies think their cost of raising new funds would be likely to drop if banks were able to underwrite corporate stocks and bonds. The survey was conducted by the staff of the Banking Committee, which is seeking to drum up support for an effort by Senator William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the panel, to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act. A staff member welcomed the results of the survey. The committee sent anonymous questionnaires to the chief financial officers of 416 non-financial companies on the Fortune 500 list and received responses from half of them. The survey found that 77 percent of the respondents agreed that the law should be repealed while 21 percent thought it should remain unchanged.
The Nets have gone through the formality of extending a contract offer to Kenny Anderson, who will become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. Anderson rejected the multiyear offer, which was worth $5 million to $6 million a season, but the Nets say they have made it a priority to resign the point guard. Still, should negotiations reach an impasse near the trading deadline on Feb. 22, the Nets aren't opposed to dealing him. There already has been discussion of a trade that would send Anderson to Philadelphia for the Sixers' center Shawn Bradley.
