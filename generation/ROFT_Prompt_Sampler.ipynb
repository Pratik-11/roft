        "1. PERCENT_MAX is an upper bound for the percentage of max length prompts in the output. If the sampler attempts to sample at max length and the article is shorter than max it will accept the full length of that article instead of resampling for another longer article. You can check how many of your samples had this happen by checking the warning at the end of the sampling prints \"Warning: 1 articles were too short for prompt length\" This may be something worth fixing in the future. \n",
